<h1>Radiation Interactions</h1>
The operation of any radiation detector basically depends on the manner in which the
radiation to be detected interacts with the material of the detector itself. An understanding
of the response of a specific type of detector must therefore be based on a familiarity with
the fundamental mechanisms by which radiations interact and lose their energy in matter.
Many general reference works are available concerning this broad topic; the classic text by
Evans, to mention only one, has served as a standard reference for several decades.

<p>To organize the discussions that follow, it is convenient to arrange the four major categories
of radiations introduced in Chapter 1 into the following matrix:</p>

<table align="center" cellpadding="10">
<tr><th>Charged Particulate Radiations</th><th></th><th>Uncharged Radiations</th></tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Heavy charged particles<br>(characteristic distance \(\cong 10^{-5} m\))</td>
<td align="center">\(\Leftarrow\)</td>
<td align="center">Neutrons<br>(characteristic length \(\cong 10^{-1} m\))</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Fast electrons<br>(characteristic distance \(\cong 10^{-3} m\))</td>
<td align="center">\(\Leftarrow\)</td>
<td align="center">X-rays and gamma rays<br>(characteristic length \(\cong 10^{-1} m\))</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The entries in the left column represent the charged particulate radiations that,
because of the electric charge carried by the particle, continuously interact through the
coulomb force with the electrons present in any medium through which they pass. The radiations
in the right column are uncharged and therefore are not subject to the coulomb
force. Instead, these radiations must first undergo a "catastrophic" interaction (often
involving the nucleus of constituent atoms) that radically alters the properties of the incident
radiation in a single encounter. In all cases of practical interest, the interaction results
in the full or partial transfer of energy of the incident radiation to electrons or nuclei of the
constituent atoms, or to charged particle products of nuclear reactions. If the interaction
does not occur within the detector, these uncharged radiations (e.g., neutrons or gamma
rays) can pass completely through the detector volume without revealing the slightest hint
that they were ever there.</p>

<p>The horizontal arrows shown in the diagram illustrate the results of such catastrophic
interactions. An \(X\text{-}\) or gamma ray, through the processes described in this chapter, can
transfer all or part of its energy to electrons within the medium. The resulting <i>secondary
electrons</i> bear a close similarity to the fast electron radiations (such as the beta particle)
discussed in Chapter 1. Devices designed to detect gamma rays are tailored to promote
such interactions and to fully stop the resulting secondary electrons so that their entire
energy may contribute to the output signal. In contrast, neutrons may interact in such a way
as to produce secondary heavy charged particles, which then serve as the basis of the detector
signal.</p>

<p>Also listed in the diagram are order-of-magnitude numbers for the characteristic distance
of penetration or average path length (range or mean free path) in solids for typical
energy radiations in each category.</p>

<h2>I. INTERACTION OF HEAVY CHARGED PARTICLES</h2>
<h3>A. Nature of the Interaction</h3>
Heavy charged particles, such as the alpha particle, interact with matter primarily through
coulomb forces between their positive charge and the negative charge of the orbital electrons
within the absorber atoms. Although interactions of the particle with nuclei (as in
Rutherford scattering or alpha-particle-induced reactions) are also possible, such encounters
occur only rarely and they are not normally significant in the response of radiation
detectors. Instead, charged particle detectors must rely on the results of interactions with
electrons for their response.

<p>Upon entering any absorbing medium, the charged particle immediately interacts
simultaneously with many electrons. In any one such encounter, the electron feels an
impulse from the attractive coulomb force as the particle passes its vicinity. Depending on
the proximity of the encounter, this impulse may be sufficient either to raise the electron
to a higher-lying shell within the absorber atom (excitation) or to remove completely the
electron from the atom (ionization). The energy that is transferred to the electron must
come at the expense of the charged particle, and its velocity is therefore decreased as a
result of the encounter. The maximum energy that can be transferred from a charged particle
of mass rn with kinetic energy \(E\) to an electron of mass \(m_{0}\) in a single collision is
\(4Em_{0}/m\), or about \(1/500\) of the particle energy per nucleon. Because this is a small fraction
of the total energy, the primary particle must lose its energy in many such interactions during
its passage through an absorber. At any given time, the particle is interacting with many
electrons, so the net effect is to decrease its velocity continuously until the particle is
stopped.</p>

<p>Representative paths taken by heavy charged particles in their slowing down process
are schematically represented in the sketch below. Except at their very end, the tracks tend
to be quite straight because the particle is not greatly deflected by any one encounter, and
interactions occur in all directions simultaneously. Charged particles are therefore characterized
by a definite range in a given absorber material. The range, to be defined more precisely
below, represents a distance beyond which no particles will penetrate.</p>

<p><img src="noname2.1.png" width="315" height="201" alt=""></p>

<p>The products of these encounters in the absorber are either excited atoms or <i>ion pairs</i>.
Each ion pair is made up of a free electron and the corresponding positive ion of an
absorber atom from which an electron has been totally removed. The ion pairs have a natural
tendency to recombine to form neutral atoms, but in some types of detectors, this
recombination is suppressed so that the ion pairs may be used as the basis of the detector
response.</p>

<p>In particularly close encounters, an electron may undergo a large enough impulse that
after having left its parent atom, it still may have sufficient kinetic energy to create further
ions. These energetic electrons are sometimes called <i>delta rays</i> and represent an indirect
means by which the charged particle energy is transferred to the absorbing medium. Under
typical conditions, the majority of the energy loss of the charged particle occurs via these
delta rays. The range of the delta rays is always small compared with the range of the incident
energetic particle, so the ionization is still formed close to the primary track. On a
microscopic scale, one effect of this process is that the ion pairs normally do not appear as
randomly spaced single ionizations, but there is a tendency to form many "clusters" of multiple
ion pairs distributed along the track of the particle.</p>

<h3>B. Stopping Power</h3>
The <i>linear stopping power</i> \(S\) for charged particles in a given absorber is simply defined as
the differential energy loss for that particle within the material divided by the corresponding
differential path length:
\[
S = - \frac{dE}{dx} \tag{2.1}
\]

The value of \(- dE/dx\) along a particle track is also called its <i>specific energy loss</i> or, more
casually, its "rate" of energy loss.

<p>For particles with a given charge state, \(S\) increases as the particle velocity is decreased.
The classical expression that describes the specific energy loss is known as the <i>Bethe
formula</i> and is written</p>
\[
 - \frac{dE}{dx} = \frac{4\pi e^{4}z^{2}}{m_{0}v^{2}}NB \tag{2.2}
\]

where
\[
B \equiv Z \left[ \ln\frac{2m_{0}v^{2}}{I} - \ln \left(  1 - \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} - \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} \right) \right]
\]

In these expressions, \(v\) and \(ze\) are the velocity and charge of the primary particle, \(N\) and \(Z\)
are the number density and atomic number of the absorber atoms, \(m_{0}\) is the <i>electron rest
mass</i>, and \(e\) is the electronic charge. The parameter \(I\) represents the average excitation and
ionization potential of the absorber and is normally treated as an experimentally determined
parameter for each element. For nonrelativistic charged particles (\(v \ll c\)), only the
first term in \(B\) is significant. Equation (2.2) is generally valid for different types of charged
particles provided their velocity remains large compared with the velocities of the orbital
electrons in the absorbing atoms.

<p>The expression for \(B\) in Eq. (2.2) varies slowly with particle energy. Thus, the general
behavior of \(dE/dx\) can be inferred from the behavior of the multiplicative factor. For a given
nonrelativistic particle, \(dE/dx\) therefore varies as \(1/v^{2}\), or inversely with particle energy. This
behavior can be heuristically explained by noting that because the charged particle spends a
greater time in the vicinity of any given electron when its velocity is low, the impulse felt by
the electron, and hence the energy transfer, is largest. When comparing different charged particles
of the same velocity, the only factor that may change outside the logarithmic term in
Eq. (2.2) is \(z^{2}\), which occurs in the numerator of the expression. Therefore, particles with the
greatest charge will have the largest specific energy loss. Alpha particles, for example, will
lose energy at a rate that is greater than protons of the same velocity but less than that of
more highly charged ions. In comparing different materials as absorbers, \(dE/dx\) depends primarily
on the product \(NZ\), which is outside the logarithmic term. This product \(NZ\) represents
the electron density of the absorber. High atomic number, high-density materials will consequently
result in the greatest linear stopping power.</p>

<p>The variation of the specific energy loss for a number of different charged particles is
shown in Fig. 2.1 over a wide energy range. This figure shows that the value of \(dE/dx\) for
many different types of charged particles approaches a near-constant broad minimum
value at energies above several hundred \(MeV\), where their velocity approaches the velocity
of light. This specific energy loss corresponds to about \(2 MeV\) per \(g/cm^{2}\) in light materials.
Because of their similar energy loss behavior, such relativistic particles are sometimes
referred to as "minimum ionizing particles." Fast electrons also fall into this category at
energies as low as about \(1 MeV\) because their much lower mass results in relativistic velocities
even at such modest energy</p>

<p><img src="fig2.1.png" width="391" height="445" alt=""></p>

<p>The Bethe formula begins to fail at low particle energies where charge exchange
between the particle and absorber becomes important. The positively charged particle will
then tend to pick up electrons from the absorber, which effectively reduce its charge and
consequent linear energy loss. At the end of its track, the particle has accumulated \(z\) electrons
and becomes a neutral atom.</p>
