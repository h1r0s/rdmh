<h1>Radiation Interactions</h1>
The operation of any radiation detector basically depends on the manner in which the
radiation to be detected interacts with the material of the detector itself. An understanding
of the response of a specific type of detector must therefore be based on a familiarity with
the fundamental mechanisms by which radiations interact and lose their energy in matter.
Many general reference works are available concerning this broad topic; the classic text by
Evans, to mention only one, has served as a standard reference for several decades.

<p>To organize the discussions that follow, it is convenient to arrange the four major categories
of radiations introduced in Chapter 1 into the following matrix:</p>

<table align="center" cellpadding="10">
<tr><th>Charged Particulate Radiations</th><th></th><th>Uncharged Radiations</th></tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Heavy charged particles<br>(characteristic distance \(\cong 10^{-5} m\))</td>
<td align="center">\(\Leftarrow\)</td>
<td align="center">Neutrons<br>(characteristic length \(\cong 10^{-1} m\))</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Fast electrons<br>(characteristic distance \(\cong 10^{-3} m\))</td>
<td align="center">\(\Leftarrow\)</td>
<td align="center">X-rays and gamma rays<br>(characteristic length \(\cong 10^{-1} m\))</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The entries in the left column represent the charged particulate radiations that,
because of the electric charge carried by the particle, continuously interact through the
coulomb force with the electrons present in any medium through which they pass. The radiations
in the right column are uncharged and therefore are not subject to the coulomb
force. Instead, these radiations must first undergo a "catastrophic" interaction (often
involving the nucleus of constituent atoms) that radically alters the properties of the incident
radiation in a single encounter. In all cases of practical interest, the interaction results
in the full or partial transfer of energy of the incident radiation to electrons or nuclei of the
constituent atoms, or to charged particle products of nuclear reactions. If the interaction
does not occur within the detector, these uncharged radiations (e.g., neutrons or gamma
rays) can pass completely through the detector volume without revealing the slightest hint
that they were ever there.</p>

<p>The horizontal arrows shown in the diagram illustrate the results of such catastrophic
interactions. An \(X\text{-}\) or gamma ray, through the processes described in this chapter, can
transfer all or part of its energy to electrons within the medium. The resulting <i>secondary
electrons</i> bear a close similarity to the fast electron radiations (such as the beta particle)
discussed in Chapter 1. Devices designed to detect gamma rays are tailored to promote
such interactions and to fully stop the resulting secondary electrons so that their entire
energy may contribute to the output signal. In contrast, neutrons may interact in such a way
as to produce secondary heavy charged particles, which then serve as the basis of the detector
signal.</p>

<p>Also listed in the diagram are order-of-magnitude numbers for the characteristic distance
of penetration or average path length (range or mean free path) in solids for typical
energy radiations in each category.</p>

<h2>I. INTERACTION OF HEAVY CHARGED PARTICLES</h2>
<h3>A. Nature of the Interaction</h3>
Heavy charged particles, such as the alpha particle, interact with matter primarily through
coulomb forces between their positive charge and the negative charge of the orbital electrons
within the absorber atoms. Although interactions of the particle with nuclei (as in
Rutherford scattering or alpha-particle-induced reactions) are also possible, such encounters
occur only rarely and they are not normally significant in the response of radiation
detectors. Instead, charged particle detectors must rely on the results of interactions with
electrons for their response.

<p>Upon entering any absorbing medium, the charged particle immediately interacts
simultaneously with many electrons. In any one such encounter, the electron feels an
impulse from the attractive coulomb force as the particle passes its vicinity. Depending on
the proximity of the encounter, this impulse may be sufficient either to raise the electron
to a higher-lying shell within the absorber atom (excitation) or to remove completely the
electron from the atom (ionization). The energy that is transferred to the electron must
come at the expense of the charged particle, and its velocity is therefore decreased as a
result of the encounter. The maximum energy that can be transferred from a charged particle
of mass rn with kinetic energy \(E\) to an electron of mass \(m_{0}\) in a single collision is
\(4Em_{0}/m\), or about \(1/500\) of the particle energy per nucleon. Because this is a small fraction
of the total energy, the primary particle must lose its energy in many such interactions during
its passage through an absorber. At any given time, the particle is interacting with many
electrons, so the net effect is to decrease its velocity continuously until the particle is
stopped.</p>

<p>Representative paths taken by heavy charged particles in their slowing down process
are schematically represented in the sketch below. Except at their very end, the tracks tend
to be quite straight because the particle is not greatly deflected by any one encounter, and
interactions occur in all directions simultaneously. Charged particles are therefore characterized
by a definite range in a given absorber material. The range, to be defined more precisely
below, represents a distance beyond which no particles will penetrate.</p>

<p><img src="noname2.1.png" width="315" height="201" alt=""></p>

<p>The products of these encounters in the absorber are either excited atoms or <i>ion pairs</i>.
Each ion pair is made up of a free electron and the corresponding positive ion of an
absorber atom from which an electron has been totally removed. The ion pairs have a natural
tendency to recombine to form neutral atoms, but in some types of detectors, this
recombination is suppressed so that the ion pairs may be used as the basis of the detector
response.</p>

<p>In particularly close encounters, an electron may undergo a large enough impulse that
after having left its parent atom, it still may have sufficient kinetic energy to create further
ions. These energetic electrons are sometimes called <i>delta rays</i> and represent an indirect
means by which the charged particle energy is transferred to the absorbing medium. Under
typical conditions, the majority of the energy loss of the charged particle occurs via these
delta rays. The range of the delta rays is always small compared with the range of the incident
energetic particle, so the ionization is still formed close to the primary track. On a
microscopic scale, one effect of this process is that the ion pairs normally do not appear as
randomly spaced single ionizations, but there is a tendency to form many "clusters" of multiple
ion pairs distributed along the track of the particle.</p>

<h3>B. Stopping Power</h3>
The <i>linear stopping power</i> \(S\) for charged particles in a given absorber is simply defined as
the differential energy loss for that particle within the material divided by the corresponding
differential path length:
\[
S = - \frac{dE}{dx} \tag{2.1}
\]

The value of \(- dE/dx\) along a particle track is also called its <i>specific energy loss</i> or, more
casually, its "rate" of energy loss.

<p>For particles with a given charge state, \(S\) increases as the particle velocity is decreased.
The classical expression that describes the specific energy loss is known as the <i>Bethe
formula</i> and is written</p>
\[
 - \frac{dE}{dx} = \frac{4\pi e^{4}z^{2}}{m_{0}v^{2}}NB \tag{2.2}
\]

where
\[
B \equiv Z \left[ \ln\frac{2m_{0}v^{2}}{I} - \ln \left(  1 - \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} - \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} \right) \right]
\]

In these expressions, \(v\) and \(ze\) are the velocity and charge of the primary particle, \(N\) and \(Z\)
are the number density and atomic number of the absorber atoms, \(m_{0}\) is the <i>electron rest
mass</i>, and \(e\) is the electronic charge. The parameter \(I\) represents the average excitation and
ionization potential of the absorber and is normally treated as an experimentally determined
parameter for each element. For nonrelativistic charged particles (\(v \ll c\)), only the
first term in \(B\) is significant. Equation (2.2) is generally valid for different types of charged
particles provided their velocity remains large compared with the velocities of the orbital
electrons in the absorbing atoms.

<p>The expression for \(B\) in Eq. (2.2) varies slowly with particle energy. Thus, the general
behavior of \(dE/dx\) can be inferred from the behavior of the multiplicative factor. For a given
nonrelativistic particle, \(dE/dx\) therefore varies as \(1/v^{2}\), or inversely with particle energy. This
behavior can be heuristically explained by noting that because the charged particle spends a
greater time in the vicinity of any given electron when its velocity is low, the impulse felt by
the electron, and hence the energy transfer, is largest. When comparing different charged particles
of the same velocity, the only factor that may change outside the logarithmic term in
Eq. (2.2) is \(z^{2}\), which occurs in the numerator of the expression. Therefore, particles with the
greatest charge will have the largest specific energy loss. Alpha particles, for example, will
lose energy at a rate that is greater than protons of the same velocity but less than that of
more highly charged ions. In comparing different materials as absorbers, \(dE/dx\) depends primarily
on the product \(NZ\), which is outside the logarithmic term. This product \(NZ\) represents
the electron density of the absorber. High atomic number, high-density materials will consequently
result in the greatest linear stopping power.</p>

<p>The variation of the specific energy loss for a number of different charged particles is
shown in Fig. 2.1 over a wide energy range. This figure shows that the value of \(dE/dx\) for
many different types of charged particles approaches a near-constant broad minimum
value at energies above several hundred \(MeV\), where their velocity approaches the velocity
of light. This specific energy loss corresponds to about \(2 MeV\) per \(g/cm^{2}\) in light materials.
Because of their similar energy loss behavior, such relativistic particles are sometimes
referred to as "minimum ionizing particles." Fast electrons also fall into this category at
energies as low as about \(1 MeV\) because their much lower mass results in relativistic velocities
even at such modest energy</p>

<p><img src="fig2.1.png" width="391" height="445" alt=""></p>

<p>The Bethe formula begins to fail at low particle energies where charge exchange
between the particle and absorber becomes important. The positively charged particle will
then tend to pick up electrons from the absorber, which effectively reduce its charge and
consequent linear energy loss. At the end of its track, the particle has accumulated \(z\) electrons
and becomes a neutral atom.</p>

<h2>C. Energy Loss Characteristics</h2>
<h3>1. THE BRAGG CURVE</h3>
A plot of the specific energy loss along the track of a charged particle such as that shown in
Fig. 2.2 is known as a <i>Bragg curve</i>. The example is shown for an alpha particle of several
\(MeV\) initial energy. For most of the track, the charge on the alpha particle is two electronic
charges, and the specific energy loss increases roughly as \(1/E\) as predicted by Eq. (2.2). Near
the end of the track, the charge is reduced through electron pickup and the curve falls off.
Plots are shown both for a single alpha particle track and for the average behavior of a
parallel beam of alpha particles of the same initial energy. The two curves differ somewhat
due to the effects of straggling, to be discussed below.

<p><img src="fig2.2.png" width="372" height="174" alt=""></p>

<p>Related plots showing \(-dE/dx\) versus particle energy for a number of different heavy
charged particles are given in Fig. 2.3. These examples illustrate the energy at which charge
pickup by the ion becomes significant. Charged particles with the greatest number of
nuclear charges begin to pick up electrons early in their slowing-down process. Note that
in an aluminum absorber, singly charged hydrogen ions (protons) show strong effects of
charge pickup below about \(100 keV\), but doubly charged \(^{3}He\) ions show equivalent effects
at about \(400 keV\).</p>

<p><img src="fig2.3.png" width="447" height="481" alt=""></p>

<h3>2. ENERGY STRAGGLING</h3>
Because the details of the microscopic interactions undergone by any specific particle vary
somewhat randomly, its energy loss is a statistical or stochastic process. Therefore, a spread
in energies always results after a beam of monoenergetic charged particles has passed
through a given thickness of absorber. The width of this energy distribution is a measure
of energy straggling, which varies with the distance along the particle track.

<p>Figure 2.4 shows a schematic presentation of the energy distribution of a beam of
initially monoenergetic particles at various points along its range. Over the first portion,
the distribution becomes wider (and more skewed) with penetration distance, showing the
increasing importance of energy straggling. Near the end of the range, the distribution narrows
again because the mean particle energy has greatly been reduced.</p>

<p><img src="fig2.4.png" width="470" height="343" alt=""></p>

<h3>D. Particle Range</h3>
In order to quantify the definition of particle range, we refer to the conceptual experiment
sketched in Fig. 2.5. Here a collimated source of monoenergetic alpha particles is counted
by a detector after passing through an absorber of variable thickness. (We later contrast the
behavior of other types of radiation when observed under similar conditions.) For alpha
particles, the results are also plotted in Fig. 2.5. For small values of the absorber thickness,
the only effect is to cause an energy loss of the alpha particles in the absorber as they pass
through. Because the tracks through the absorber are quite straight, the total number that
reach the detector remains the same. No attenuation in the number of alpha particles takes
place until the absorber thickness approaches the length of the shortest track in the absorbing
material. Increasing the thickness then stops more and more of the alpha particles, and
the intensity of the detected beam drops rapidly to zero.

<p><img src="fig2.5.png" width="472" height="240" alt=""></p>

<p>The range of the alpha particles in the absorber material can be determined from this
curve in several ways. The mean range is defined as the absorber thickness that reduces the
alpha particle count to exactly one-half of its value in the absence of the absorber.
This definition is most commonly used in tables of numerical range values. Another version
that appears in the literature is the extrapolated range, which is obtained by extrapolating
the linear portion of the end of the transmission curve to zero.</p>

<p>The range of charged particles of a given energy is thus a fairly unique quantity in a
specific absorber material. In the early days of radiation measurement, experiments of the
type sketched in Fig. 2.5 were widely used to measure the energy of alpha particles indirectly
by determining the absorber thickness equivalent to their mean range. With the
availability of detectors that provide an output signal directly related to the alpha particle
energy, such indirect measurements are no longer necessary.</p>

<p>Some graphs of the mean range of various charged particles in materials of interest in
detectors are given in Figs. 2.6 through 2.8. As one obvious application of these curves, any
detector that is to measure the full incident energy of a charged particle must have an
active thickness that is greater than the range of that particle in the detector material.</p>

<p><img src="fig2.6.png" width="459" height="623" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="fig2.7.png" width="445" height="668" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="fig2.8.png" width="508" height="646" alt=""></p>

<h3>2. RANGE STRAGGLING</h3>
Charged particles are also subject to range straggling, defined as the fluctuation in path
length for individual particles of the same initial energy. The same stochastic factors that
lead to energy straggling at a given penetration distance also result in slightly different
total path lengths for each particle. For heavy charged particles such as protons or alphas,
the straggling amounts to a few percent of the mean range. The degree of straggling is evidenced
by the sharpness of the cutoff at the end of the average transmission curve plotted
in Fig. 2.2. Differentiating this curve leads to a peak whose width is often taken as a quantitative
measure of the importance of range straggling for the particles and absorber used
in the measurement.

<h3>3. STOPPING TIME</h3>
The time required to stop a charged particle in an absorber can be deduced from its range
and average velocity. For nonrelativistic particles of mass m and kinetic energy \(E\), the
velocity is
\[
v
 = \sqrt{\frac{2E}{m}} 
 = c \sqrt{\frac{2E}{mc^{2}}} 
 = \left( 3.00 \times 10^{8}\frac{m}{s} \right)\sqrt{\frac{2E}{(931 MeV/amu)m_{A}}}
\]

where \(m_{A}\) is the particle mass in atomic mass units and \(E\) is the particle energy in \(MeV\). If
we assume that the average particle velocity as it slows down is \(\langle v \rangle = Kv\), where \(v\) is evaluated
at the initial energy, then the stopping time \(T\) can be calculated from the range \(R\) as
\[
T
 = \frac{R}{\langle v \rangle}
 = \frac{R}{Kc}\sqrt{\frac{mc^{2}}{2E}} 
 = \frac{R}{K(3.00 \times 10^{8} m/s)}\sqrt{\frac{931 MeV/amu}{2}}\sqrt{\frac{m_{A}}{E}}
\]

If the particle were uniformly decelerated, then \(\langle v \rangle\) would be given by \(v/2\) and \(K\) would be \(0.5\).
However, charged particles generally lose energy at a greater rate near the end of their
range, and \(K\) should be a somewhat higher fraction. By assuming \(K = 0.60\), the stopping
time can be estimated as
\[
T \cong 1.2 \times 10^{-7}R\sqrt{\frac{m_{A}}{E}} \tag{2.3}
\]

where \(T\) is in seconds, \(R\) in meters, \(m_{A}\) in \(amu\), and \(E\) in \(MeV\). This approximation is
expected to be reasonably accurate for light charged particles (protons, alpha particles,
etc.) over much of the energy range of interest here. It is not, however, to be used for
relativistic particles such as fast electrons.

<p>Using typical range values, stopping times calculated from Eq. (2.3) for charged particles
are a few picoseconds in solids or liquids and a few nanoseconds in gases. These times
are generally small enough to be neglected for all but the fastest-responding radiation
detectors.</p>

<h3>E. Energy Loss in Thin Absorbers</h3>
For thin absorbers (or detectors) that are penetrated by a given charged particle, the energy
deposited within the absorber can be calculated from
Particle energy
\[
\Delta E = - \left( \frac{dE}{dx} \right)_{avg}t \tag{2.4}
\]

where \(t\) is the absorber thickness and \((-dE/dx)_{avg}\) is the linear stopping power averaged
over the energy of the particle while in the absorber. If the energy loss is small, the stopping
power does not change much and it can be approximated by its value at the incident
particle energy. Tabular values for \(dE/dx\) for a number of different charged particles in a
variety of absorbing media are given in Refs. 5-10. Some graphs for materials of interest
are shown in Figs. 2.9 through 2.11.

<p><img src="fig2.9.png" width="505" height="629" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="fig2.10.png" width="587" height="642" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="fig2.11.png" width="579" height="461" alt=""></p>

<p>For absorber thicknesses through which the energy loss is not small, it is not simple to
obtain a properly weighted \((-dE/dx)_{avg}\) value directly from such data. In these cases, it is
easier to obtain the deposited energy in a way that makes use of range-energy data of the
type plotted in Figs. 2.6 through 2.8. The basis of the method is as follows: Let \(R_{1}\) represent
the full range of the incident particle with energy Eo in the absorber material. By subtracting
the physical thickness of the absorber \(t\) from \(R_{1}\), a value \(R_{2}\) is obtained that represents
the range of those alpha particles that emerge from the opposite surface of the absorber.
By finding the energy corresponding to \(R_{2}\), the energy of the transmitted charged particles
\(E_{t}\) is obtained. The deposited energy \(\Delta E\) is then given simply by \(E_{0} - E_{\gamma}\). These steps are
illustrated below:</p>

<p><img src="noname2.2.png" width="434" height="160" alt=""></p>

The procedure is based on the assumption that the charged particle tracks are perfectly linear
in the absorber, and the method does not apply in situations where the particle can be
significantly deflected (such as for fast electrons).

<p>The combined effects of particle range and the decrease in \(dE/dx\). with increasing energy
are illustrated in Fig. 2.12. Here the energy loss of protons in a thin detector is plotted
versus the incident proton energy. For low energies, the proton range is less than the detector
thickness. Therefore, as the energy is increased, the energy deposited in the detector
(which is just equal to the incident energy) increases linearly. At a proton energy of
\(425 keV\), the range is exactly equal to the detector thickness. For higher energies, only a
portion of incident energy is deposited, and the transmitted proton carries off the remainder.
Under these conditions, the energy deposited in the detector is given by Eq. (2.4), or
simply the product of the detector thickness and the average linear stopping power.
Because the stopping power continuously decreases with increasing energy in this region
(see Fig. 2.3), the deposited energy therefore decreases with further increases in the
incident proton energy. The second curve in Fig. 2.12 plots the transmitted energy (\(E_{t}\) on
the diagram on the preceding page) as recorded by a second thick detector.</p>

<p><img src="fig2.12.png" width="497" height="341" alt=""></p>

<h3>F. Scaling Laws</h3>
Sometimes data are not available on the range or energy loss characteristics of precisely the
same particle-absorber combination needed in a given experiment. Recourse must then be
made to various approximations, most of which are derived based on the Bethe formula
[Eq. (2.2)] and on the assumption that the stopping power per atom of compounds or mixtures
is additive. This latter assumption, known as the <i>Bragg-Kleeman rule</i>, may be written
\[
\frac{1}{N_{c}}\left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{c} = \sum_{i}W_{i}\frac{1}{N_{i}}\left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{i} \tag{2.5}
\]

In this expression, \(N\) is the atomic density, \(dE/dx\) is the linear stopping power, and \(W_{i}\) represents
the atom fraction of the \(i\)th component in the compound (subscript \(c\)). As an example
of the application of Eq. (2.5), the linear stopping power of alpha particles in a metallic
oxide could be obtained from separate data on the stopping power in both the pure
metal and in oxygen. Some caution should be used in applying such results, however, since
some measurements for compounds have indicated a stopping power differing by as
much as 10-20% from that calculated from Eq. (2.5).

<p>It can be shown that the range of a charged particle in a compound material can also
be estimated provided its range is known in all the constituent elements. In this derivation,
it is necessary to assume that the shape of the \(dE/dx\) curve is independent of the stopping
medium. Under these conditions, the range in the compound is given by
\[
R_{c} = \frac{M_{c}}{\sum_{i}n_{i}(A_{i}/R_{i})} \tag{2.6}
\]

where \(R_{i}\) is the range in element \(i\), \(n_{i}\) is the number of atoms of element \(i\) in the molecule,
\(A_{i}\) is the atomic weight of element \(i\), and \(M_{c}\) is the molecular weight of the compound.</p>

<p>If range data are not available for all the constituent elements, estimates can be made
based on a semiempirical formula (commonly called the Bragg-Kleeman rule as well)
\[
\frac{R_{1}}{R_{0}} \cong \frac{\rho_{0}\sqrt{A_{1}}}{\rho_{1}\sqrt{A_{0}}} \tag{2.7}
\]

where \(\rho\) and \(A\) represent density and atomic weight, and subscripts \(0\) and \(1\) refer to different
absorbing materials.The accuracy of this estimate diminishes when the two materials are
of widely different atomic weights, so it is always best to use range data from a material that
is as close as possible in A to the absorber of interest.</p>

<p>Range data can also be generalized to different charged particles within a given
absorber material. By integration of Eq. (2.2), it can be shown that the range of a particle
of mass \(m\)) and charge \(z\) can be represented by
\[
R_{v} = \frac{m}{z^{2}}F(v) \tag{2.8}
\]

where \(F(v)\) represents a unique function of the particle initial velocity \(v\). For particles of
the same initial velocity, this factor will be identical and therefore we can write
\[
R_{a}(v) = \frac{m_{a}z_{b}^{2}}{m_{b}z_{a}^{2}}R_{b}(v) \tag{2.9}
\]

where the subscripts \(a\) and \(b\) refer to different charged particles. Thus, the range of a particle
for which data are not available can be estimated by calculating its initial velocity, finding
the range of any other particle of the same initial velocity in the same material, and
applying Eq. (2.9). It should be emphasized that these estimates are only approximate,
because no account is taken of the change in charge state of the particle as it nears the end
of its path. Correction factors necessary to compensate for this effect and predict the range
more accurately are presented by Evans.</p>

<h3>G. Behavior of Fission Fragments</h3>
The heavy fragments produced as a result of neutron-induced or spontaneous fission of
heavy nuclei are energetic charged particles with properties somewhat different from those
discussed up to this point. Because the fragments start out stripped of many electrons, their
very large effective charge results in a specific energy loss greater than that encountered
with any other radiations discussed in this text. Because the initial energy is also very high
(see Fig. 1.4b), however, the range of a typical fission fragment is approximately half that
of a \(5 MeV\) alpha particle.

<p>An important feature of a fission fragment track is the fact that the specific energy loss
\((-dE/dx)\) decreases as the particle loses energy in the absorber.This behavior is in marked
contrast to the lighter particles, such as alpha particles or protons, and is a result of the continuous
decrease in the effective charge carried by the fragment as its velocity is reduced.
The pickup of electrons begins immediately at the start of the track, and therefore the factor
\(z\) in the numerator of Eq. (2.2) continuously drops. The resulting decrease in \(-dE/dx\)
is large enough to overcome the increase that normally accompanies a reduction in velocity.
For particles with much lower initial charge state, such as the alpha particle, electron
pickup does not become significant until near the end of the range.</p>

<h3>H. Secondary Electron Emission from Surfaces</h3>
As charged particles lose their kinetic energy during the slowing-down process, many electrons
from the absorber are given a sufficient impulse to travel a short distance from the
original track of the particle. These include the delta rays mentioned earlier, whose energy
is high enough to ionize other absorber atoms, and also electrons whose kinetic energy of
only a few \(eV\) is below the minimum energy for further ionization. If an energetic charged
particle is incident on or emerges from a solid surface, some of these electrons may migrate
to the surface and have sufficient energy to escape. The term secondary electrons is conventionally
applied to these escaping low-energy electrons. (<i>Note</i>: The same term is often
used to characterize the much more energetic electrons formed in the gamma-ray interactions
described later in this chapter ー a very different type of secondary electron.)

<p>A single heavy ion such as a fission fragment can produce hundreds of these escaping
secondaries, whereas lighter alpha particles might typically result in 10 or fewer secondaries
per particle. Fast electrons such as beta particles are much less likely to create escaping
secondaries, and only a few percent will result in secondary emission. To a first approximation,
the yield of secondaries will be proportional to the energy lost within a near-surface
layer whose thickness represents the maximum distance an electron will tend to
migrate from its point of origin and still retain enough energy to escape from the surface.
Thus, the \(dE/dx\) value of the particle is a reasonable predictor of secondary yield from a
given material. Those materials with low work function and large escape distance will have
the largest yield. Thin films of alkali halides, and cesium iodide in particular, are observed
to produce secondaries with high yield. Models of the electron transport in alkali halides
confirm their suitability as prolific sources of secondary electrons.</p>

<p>The energy spectrum of these escaping secondary electrons is a continuum with a
mean value that is very low compared with the primary particle energy. For example, the
energy of secondaries from a carbon surface average \(60-100 eV\) for alpha particles and
\(290 eV\) for fission fragments. The energy of secondary electrons produced by lighter particles
such as fast electrons is even lower. Thus it is normally difficult or impossible to
observe the secondaries since they are readily reabsorbed even in air. If they are emitted
into a vacuum or low-pressure gas, however, they can be accelerated and easily guided by
electric fields because of their low initial velocity. For example, an electric field created by
the application of \(1000 V\) with respect to the surface would have a strong influence on the
trajectory of a \(100 eV\) electron, but almost no effect on a \(1 MeV\) fast electron. This property
has led to the successful use of secondary electron emission from surfaces as a means
of detecting the positions at which beta particles emerge from a surface and in the imaging
of X-rays and fast electrons. Secondary electrons emitted from a thin foil and directed
to an external electron detector such as a microchannel plate have also served as the
basis for fast timing measurements with heavy ions. One special application of the secondary
electron emission process will be detailed in Chapter 9, where a typical electron in
a photomultiplier tube is accelerated to a few hundred eV before striking a solid surface,
causing the emission of 5-10 secondaries in a charge multiplication process.</p>

<h2>II. INTERACTION OF FAST ELECTRONS</h2>
When compared with heavy charged particles, fast electrons lose their energy at a lower
rate and follow a much more tortuous path through absorbing materials. A series of tracks
from a source of monoenergetic electrons might appear as in the sketch below:

<p><img src="noname2.3.png" width="310" height="127" alt=""></p>

Large deviations in the electron path are now possible because its mass is equal to that of
the orbital electrons with which it is interacting, and a much larger fraction of its energy
can be lost in a single encounter. In addition, electron-nuclear interactions, which can
abruptly change the electron direction, sometimes occur.

<h3>A. Specific Energy Loss</h3>
An expression similar to that of Eq. (2.2) has also been derived by Bethe to describe the specific
energy loss due to ionization and excitation (the " collisional losses") for fast electrons:
\[
-\left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{c}

 	\right) \tag{2.10}
\]

where the symbols have the same meaning as in Eq. (2.2) and \(\beta = v/c\).

<p>Electrons also differ from heavy charged particles in that energy may be lost by radiative
processes as well as by coulomb interactions. These radiative losses take the form of
bremsstrahlung or electromagnetic radiation, which can emanate from any position along
the electron track. From classical theory, any charge must radiate energy when accelerated,
and the deflections of the electron in its interactions with the absorber correspond to such
acceleration. The linear specific energy loss through this radiative process is
\[
-\left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{r}
	= \frac{NEZ(Z + 1)e^{4}}{137m_{0}^{2}c^{4}}\left(4\ln\frac{2E}{m_{0}c^{4}} - \frac{4}{3}\right) \tag{2.11}
\]
</p>

<p>For the particle types and energy ranges of interest in this text, only fast electrons can
have a significant yield of bremsstrahlung. The yield from heavy charged particles is negligible
as indicated by the presence of the \(m_{0}^{2}\) factor in the denominator of the multiplicative
term in Eq. (2.11). The factors of \(E\) and \(Z^{2}\) in the numerator of Eq. (2.11) show that radiative
losses are most important for high electron energies and for absorber materials of
large atomic number. For typical electron energies, the average bremsstrahlung photon
energy is quite low (see Fig. 1.6) and is therefore normally reabsorbed fairly close to its
point of origin. In some cases, however, the escape of bremsstrahlung can influence the
response of small detectors.</p>

<p>The total linear stopping power for electrons is the sum of the collisional and radiative
losses:
\[
\frac{dE}{dx} = \left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{c} + \left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{r} \tag{2.12}
\]

The ratio of the specific energy losses is given approximately by
\[
\frac{(dE/dx)_{r}}{(dE/dx)_{c}} \cong \frac{EZ}{700} \tag{2.13}
\]

where \(E\) is in units of \(MeV\). For the electrons of interest here (such as beta particles or secondary
electrons from gamma-ray interactions), typical energies are less than a few \(MeV\).
Therefore, radiative losses are always a small fraction of the energy losses due to ionization
and excitation and are significant only in absorber materials of high atomic number.</p>

<h3>B. Electron Range and Transmission Curves</h3>
<h4>1. ABSORPTION OF MONOENERGETIC ELECTRONS</h4>
An attenuation experiment of the type discussed earlier for alpha particles is sketched in
Fig. 2.13 for a source of monoenergetic fast electrons. Even small values of the absorber
thickness lead to the loss of some electrons from the detected beam because scattering of
the electron effectively removes it from the flux striking the detector. A plot of the detected
number of electrons versus absorber thickness therefore begins to drop immediately and
gradually approaches zero for large absorber thicknesses. Those electrons that penetrate
the greatest absorber thickness will be the ones whose initial direction has changed least in
their path through the absorber.

<p><img src="fig2.13.png" width="588" height="193" alt=""></p>

<p>The concept of range is less definite for fast electrons than for heavy charged particles,
because the electron total path length is considerably greater than the distance of penetration
along the initial velocity vector. Normally, the electron range is taken from a transmission
plot, such as that given in Fig. 2.13, by extrapolation of the linear portion of the
curve to zero and represents the absorber thickness required to ensure that almost no electrons
can penetrate the entire thickness.</p>

<p><img src="fig2.14.png" width="591" height="662" alt=""></p>

<p>For equivalent energy, the specific energy loss of electrons is much lower than that of
heavy charged particles, so their path length in typical absorbers is hundreds of times
greater. As a very crude estimate, electron ranges tend to be about \(2 mm\) per \(MeV\) in low-density
materials, or about \(1 mm\) per \(MeV\) in materials of moderate density</p>

<p>Tabular data are given in Refs. 22 and 23 for the stopping power and range of electrons
and positrons in elements and compounds, covering a large region of energy. To a fair
degree of approximation, the product of the range times the density of the absorber is a
constant for different materials for electrons of equal initial energy. Plots of the range of
electrons in two common detector materials are given in Fig. 2.14.</p>

<h4>2. ABSORPTION OF BETA PARTICLES</h4>
<p><img src="fig2.15.png" width="392" height="357" alt=""></p>

The transmission curve for beta particles emitted by a radioisotope source, because of the
continuous distribution in their energy, differs significantly from that sketched in Fig. 2.13
for monoenergetic electrons. The "soft" or low-energy beta particles are rapidly absorbed
even in small thicknesses of the absorber, so that the initial slope on the attenuation curve
is much greater. For the majority of beta spectra, the curve happens to have a near-exponential
shape and is therefore nearly linear on the semilog plot of the type shown in
Fig. 2.15. This exponential behavior is only an empirical approximation and does not have
a fundamental basis as does the exponential attenuation of gamma rays [see Eq. (2.20)]. An
<i>absorption coefficient</i> \(n\) is sometimes defined by
\[
\frac{I}{I_{0}} = e^{-nt} \tag{2.14}
\]
where
\begin{eqnarray}
I_{0} &=& {\rm counting \, rate \, without \, absorber} \\
I     &=& {\rm counting \, rate \, with \, absorber} \\
t     &=& {\rm absorber \, thickness \, in \,} g/cm^{2}
\end{eqnarray}

<p>The coefficient \(n\) correlates well with the endpoint energy of the beta emitter for a specific
absorbing material. This dependence is shown in Fig. 2.16 for aluminum. Through the
use of such data, attenuation measurements can be used to identify indirectly endpoint
energies of unknown beta emitters, although direct energy measurements are more
common.</p>

<h4>3. BACKSCATTERING</h4>
The fact that electrons often undergo large-angle deflections along their tracks leads to the
phenomenon of <i>backscattering</i>. An electron entering one surface of an absorber may
undergo sufficient deflection so that it re-emerges from the surface through which it
entered. These backscattered electrons do not deposit all their energy in the absorbing
medium and therefore can have a significant effect on the response of detectors designed
to measure the energy of externally incident electrons. Electrons that backscatter in the
detector "entrance window" or dead layer will escape detection entirely.

<p>Backscattering is most pronounced for electrons with low incident energy and
absorbers with high atomic number. Figure 2.17 shows the fraction of monoenergetic electrons
that are backscattered when normally incident on the surface of various absorbers.
Additional data for materials commonly used as electron detectors are given in Table 10.1.</p>

<p><img src="fig2.17.png" width="472" height="627" alt=""></p>

<p>Backscattering can also influence the apparent yield from radioisotope sources of beta
particles or conversion electrons. If the source is deposited on a thick backing, electrons
that are emitted initially into this backing may backscatter and re-emerge from the surface
of the source.</p>

<h3>C. Positron Interactions</h3>
The coulomb forces that constitute the major mechanism of energy loss for both electrons and
heavy charged particles are present for either positive or negative charge on the particle.
Whether the interaction involves a repulsive or attractive force between the incident particle
and orbital electron, the impulse and energy transfer for particles of equal mass are about the
same. Therefore, the tracks of positrons in an absorber are similar to those of normal negative
electrons, and their specific energy loss and range are about the same for equal initial energies.

<p>Positrons differ significantly, however, in that the annihilation radiation described in
Chapter 1 is generated at the end of the positron track. Because these \(0.511\) MeV photons
are very penetrating compared with the range of the positron, they can lead to the deposition
of energy far from the original positron track.</p>
