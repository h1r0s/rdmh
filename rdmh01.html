<h1>Radiation Sources</h1>
The radiations of primary concern in this text originate in atomic or nuclear processes.
They are conveniently categorized into four general types as follows:
<table cellpadding="10">
<tr>

\(
	\left\{
		\begin{array}{c}

	\right.
\)
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<i>Fast electrons</i> include beta particles (positive or negative) emitted in nuclear decay, as well
as energetic electrons produced by any other process. <i>Heavy charged particles</i> denote a category
that encompasses all energetic ions with mass of one atomic mass unit or greater,
such as alpha particles, protons, fission products, or the products of many nuclear reactions.
The <i>electromagnetic radiation</i> of interest includes X-rays emitted in the rearrangement of
electron shells of atoms, and gamma rays that originate from transitions within the nucleus
itself. <i>Neutrons</i> generated in various nuclear processes constitute the final major category,
which is often further divided into <i>slow neutron</i> and <i>fast neutron</i> subcategories (see
Chapter 14).

<p>The energy range of interest spans over six decades, ranging from about \(10 eV\) to
\(20 MeV\). (Slow neutrons are technically an exception but are included because of their
technological importance.) The lower energy bound is set by the minimum energy required
to produce ionization in typical materials by the radiation or the secondary products of its
interaction. Radiations with energy greater than this minimum are classified as ionizing
radiations. The upper bound is chosen to limit the topics in this coverage to those of primary
concern in nuclear science and technology.</p>

<p>The main emphasis in this chapter will be the laboratory-scale sources of these radiations,
which are likely to be of interest either in the calibration and testing of radiation
detectors described in the following chapters, or as objects of the measurements themselves.
Natural background radiation is an important additional source and is discussed
separately in Chapter 20.</p>

<p>The radiations of interest differ in their "hardness" or ability to penetrate thicknesses
of material. Although this property is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 2, it is also of
considerable concern in determining the physical form of radiation sources. Soft radiations,
such as alpha particles or low-energy X-rays, penetrate only small thicknesses of material.
Radioisotope sources must therefore be deposited in very thin layers if a large fraction of
these radiations is to escape from the source itself. Sources that are physically thicker are
subject to "self-absorption," which is likely to affect both the number and the energy spectrum
of the radiations that emerge from its surface.Typical thicknesses for such sources are
therefore measured in micrometers. Beta particles are generally more penetrating, and
sources up to a few tenths of a millimeter in thickness can usually be tolerated. Harder
radiations, such as gamma rays or neutrons, are much less affected by self-absorption and
sources can be millimeters or centimeters in dimension without seriously affecting the radiation
properties.</p>

<h2>I. UNITS AND DEFINITIONS</h2>
<h3>A. Radioactivity</h3>
The <i>activity</i> of a radioisotope source is defined as its rate of decay and is given by the fundamental
law of radioactive decay
\[
\left. \frac{dN}{dt} \right|_{\rm decay} = - \lambda N \tag{1.1}
\]

where \(N\) is the number of radioactive nuclei and \(\lambda\) is defined as the <i>decay constant</i>. The
historical unit of activity has been the <i>curie</i> (\(Ci\)), defined as exactly \(3.7 \times 10^{10} disintegrations/
second\), which owes its definition to its origin as the best available estimate of the
activity of 1 gram of pure \(^{226}Ra\). Its submultiples, the millicurie (\(mCi\)) or microcurie (\(\mu Ci\)),
generally are more suitable units for laboratory-scale radioisotope sources.

<p>Although still widely used in the literature, the curie is destined to be replaced gradually
by its SI equivalent, the becquerel (\(Bq\)). At its 1975 meeting, the General Conference
of Weights and Measures (GCPM) adopted a resolution declaring that the becquerel.
defined as one disintegration per second, has become the standard unit of activity. Thus
\[
1 Bq = 2.703 \times 10^{-11} Ci
\]

Radioactive sources of convenient size in the laboratory are most reasonably measured in
kilobecquerels (\(kBq\)) or megabecquerels (\(MBq\)).</p>

<p>It should be emphasized that activity measures the source disintegration rate, which is
not synonymous with the emission rate of radiation produced in its decay. Frequently, a
given radiation will be emitted in only a fraction of all the decays, so a knowledge of the
decay scheme of the particular isotope is necessary to infer a radiation emission rate from
its activity. Also, the decay of a given radioisotope may lead to a daughter product whose
activity also contributes to the radiation yield from the source. A complete listing of
radioisotope decay schemes is tabulated in Ref. 1.</p>

<p>The <i>specific activity</i> of a radioactive source is defined as the activity per unit mass of
the radioisotope sample. If a pure or "carrier-free" sample is obtained that is unmixed with
any other nuclear species, its specific activity can be calculated from
\[
{\rm specific \, activity} = {\rm \frac{activity}{mass}} = \frac{\lambda N}{NM / A_{\nu}} = \frac{\lambda N}{M} \tag{1.2}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
M &=& {\rm molecular \, weight \, of \, sample} \\
A_{\nu} &=& {\rm Avogadro's \, number (= 6.02 \times 10^{23} nuclei/mole)} \\
\lambda &=& {\rm radioisotope \, decay \, constant (= \ln 2/half\text{-}life)}
\end{eqnarray}

Radioisotopes are seldom obtained in carrier-free form, however, and are usually diluted
in a much larger concentration of stable nuclei of the same element. Also, if not prepared
in pure elemental form, additional stable nuclei may be included from other elements that
are chemically combined with those of the source. For sources in which self-absorption is a
problem, there is a premium on obtaining a sample with high specific activity to maximize
the number of radioactive nuclei within a given thickness. From Eq. (1.2), high specific
activity is most readily obtained using radionuclides with large \(\lambda\) (or small half-life).</p>

<h3>B. Energy</h3>
The traditional unit for measurement of radiation energy is the <i>electron volt</i> or \(eV\), defined
as the kinetic energy gained by an electron by its acceleration through a potential difference
of 1 volt. The multiples of kiloelectron volt (\(keV\)) and megaelectron volt (\(MeV\)) are
more common in the measurement of energies for ionizing radiation. The electron volt is a
convenient unit when dealing with particulate radiation because the energy gained from an
electric field can easily be obtained by multiplying the potential difference by the number
of electronic charges carried by the particle. For example, an alpha particle that carries an
electron charge of \(+2\) will gain an energy of \(2 keV\) when accelerated by a potential difference
of 1000 volts.

<p>The SI unit of energy is the joule (\(J\)). When dealing with radiation energies, the submultiple
femtojoule (\(fJ\)) is more convenient and is related to the electron volt by the
conversion
\[
1eV = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} J
\]

or
\[
1fj = 1 \times 10^{-15}J = 6.241 \times 10^{3}eV
\]

It is not clear to what extent the electron volt will be phased out in future usage because
its physical basis and universal use in the literature are strong arguments for its continued
application to radiation measurements.</p>

<p>The energy of an X- or gamma-ray photon is related to the radiation frequency by
\[
E = h \nu \tag{1.3}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
h &=& {\rm Planck's \, constant (6.626 \times 10^{-34}J \cdot s, or 4.135 \times 10^{-15} eV \cdot s)} \\
\nu &=& frequency
\end{eqnarray}

The wavelength \(\lambda\) is related to the photon energy by
\[
\lambda = \frac{1.240 \times 10^{-6}}{E}
\]

where \(\lambda\) is in meters and \(E\) in \(eV\).</p>

<h2>11. FAST ELECTRON SOURCES</h2>
<h3>A. Beta Decay</h3>
The most common source of fast electrons in radiation measurements is a radioisotope that
decays by beta-minus emission. The process is written schematically
\[
^{A}_{Z}X \rightarrow ^{A}_{Z + 1}Y + \beta^{-} + \overline{\nu} \tag{1.4}
\]

where \(X\) and \(Y\) are the initial and final nuclear species, and \(\overline{\nu}\) is the antineutrino. Because
neutrinos and antineutrinos have an extremely small interaction probability with matter,
they are undetectable for all practical purposes. The recoil nucleus \(Y\) appears with a very
small recoil energy, which is ordinarily below the ionization threshold, and therefore it cannot
be detected by conventional means. Thus, the only significant ionizing radiation produced
by beta decay is the fast electron or beta particle itself.

<p>Because most radionuclides produced by neutron bombardment of stable materials are
beta-active, a large assortment of beta emitters are readily available through production in
a reactor flux. Species with many different half-lives can be obtained, ranging from thousands
of years down to as short a half-life as is practical in the application. Most beta decays
populate an excited state of the product nucleus, so that the subsequent de-excitation
gamma rays are emitted together with beta particles in many common beta sources. Some
examples of nuclides that decay directly to the ground state of the product and are therefore
"pure beta emitters" are shown in Table 1.1.</p>

<p><img src="tab1.1.png" width="475" height="417" alt=""></p>

<p>Each specific beta decay transition is characterized by a fixed decay energy or \(Q\)-value.
Because the energy of the recoil nucleus is virtually zero, this energy is shared between the
beta particle and the "invisible" neutrino. The beta particle thus appears with an energy
that varies from decay to decay and can range from zero to the "beta endpoint energy,"
which is numerically equal to the \(Q\)-value. A representative beta energy spectrum is illustrated
in Fig. 1.1. The \(Q\)-value for a given decay is normally quoted assuming that the
transition takes place between the ground states of both the parent and daughter nuclei. If
the transition involves an excited state of either the parent or daughter, the endpoint energy
of the corresponding beta spectrum will be changed by the difference in excitation energies.
Since several excited states can be populated in some decay schemes, the measured beta particle
spectrum may then consist of several components with different endpoint energies.</p>

<p><img src="fig1.1.png" width="575" height="236" alt=""></p>

<h3>B. Internal Conversion</h3>
The continuum of energies produced by any beta source is inappropriate for some applications.
For example, if an energy calibration is to be carried out for an electron detector,
it is much more convenient to use a source of monoenergetic electrons. The nuclear process
of <i>internal conversion</i> can be the source of conversion electrons, which are, under some circumstances,
nearly monoenergetic.

<p>The internal conversion process begins with an excited nuclear state, which may be
formed by a preceding process ー often beta decay of a parent species. The common method
of de-excitation is through emission of a gamma ray-photon. For some excited states,
gamma emission may be somewhat inhibited and the alternative of internal conversion can
become significant. Here the nuclear excitation energy \(E_{ex}\) is transferred directly to one of
the orbital electrons of the atom. This electron then appears with an energy given by
\[
E_{e} = E_{ex} - E_{b} \tag{1.5}
\]

where \(E_{b}\) is its binding energy in the original electron shell.</p>

<p>An example of a conversion electron spectrum is shown in Fig. 1.2. Because the conversion
electron can originate from any one of a number of different electron shells within
the atom, a single nuclear excitation level generally leads to several groups of electrons
with different energies. The spectrum may be further complicated in those cases in which
more than one excited state within the nucleus is converted. Furthermore, the electron
energy spectrum may also be superimposed on a continuum consisting of the beta spectrum
of the parent nucleus that leads to the excited state. Despite these shortcomings, conversion
electrons are the only practical laboratory-scale source of monoenergetic electron
groups in the high \(keV\) to \(MeV\) energy range. Several useful radioisotope sources of conversion
electrons are compiled in Table 1.2.</p>

<p><img src="fig1.2.png" width="649" height="348" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="tab1.2.png" width="652" height="387" alt=""></p>

<h3>C. Auger Electrons</h3>
<i>Auger electrons</i> are roughly the analogue of internal conversion electrons when the excitation
energy originates in the atom rather than in the nucleus. A preceding process (such
as electron capture) may leave the atom with a vacancy in a normally complete electron
shell. This vacancy is often filled by an electron from one of the outer shells of the atom
with the emission of a characteristic X-ray photon. Alternatively, the excitation energy of
the atom may be transferred directly to one of the outer electrons, causing it to be ejected
from the atom. This electron is called an Auger electron and appears with an energy given
by the difference between the original atomic excitation energy and the binding energy of
the shell from which the electron was ejected. Auger electrons therefore produce a discrete
energy spectrum, with different groups corresponding to different initial and final states. In
all cases, their energy is relatively low compared with beta particles or conversion electrons,
particularly because Auger electron emission is favored only in low-\(Z\) elements for
which electron binding energies are small. Typical Auger electrons with a few \(keV\) initial
energy are subject to pronounced self-absorption within the source and are easily stopped
by very thin source covers or detector entrance windows.

<h2>III. HEAVY CHARGED PARTICLE SOURCES</h2>
<h3>A. Alpha Decay</h3>
Heavy nuclei are energetically unstable against the spontaneous emission of an alpha particle
(or \(^{4}He\) nucleus). The probability of decay is governed by the <i>barrier penetration</i>
mechanism described in most texts on nuclear physics, and the half-life of useful sources
varies from days to many thousands of years. The decay process is written schematically as
\[
^{A}_{Z}X \rightarrow ^{A - 4}_{Z - 2}Y + ^{4}_{2}\alpha
\]

where \(X\) and \(Y\) are the initial and final nuclear species. A representative alpha decay
scheme is shown in Fig. 1.3, together with the expected energy spectrum of the corresponding
alpha particles emitted in the decay.

<p><img src="fig1.3.png" width="485" height="616" alt=""></p>

<p>The alpha particles appear in one or more energy groups that are, for all practical purposes,
monoenergetic. For each distinct transition between initial and final nucleus (e.g.,
between ground state and ground state), a fixed energy difference or \(Q\)-value characterizes
the decay. This energy is shared between the alpha particle and the recoil nucleus in a
unique way, so that each alpha particle appears with the same energy given by \(Q(A - 4)/A\).
There are many practical instances in which only one such transition is involved and for
which the alpha particles are therefore emitted with a unique single energy. Other examples
such as that shown in Fig. 1.3, may involve more than one transition energy so that the
alpha particles appear in groups with differing relative intensities.</p>

<p>Table 1.3 lists some properties of the more common radioisotope sources of alpha particles.
It is no accident that most alpha particle energies are limited to between about \(4\) and
\(6 MeV\). There is a very strong correlation between alpha particle energy and half-life of the
parent isotope, and those with the highest energies are those with the shortest half-life.
Beyond about \(6.5 MeV\), the half-life can be expected to be less than a few days, and therefore
the source is of very limited utility. On the other hand, if the energy drops below
\(4 MeV\), the barrier penetration probability becomes very small and the half-life of the isotope
is very large. If the half-life is exceedingly long, the specific activity attainable in a
practical sample of the material becomes very small and the source is of no interest
because its intensity is too low. Probably the most common calibration source for alpha
particles is \(^{241}Am\), and an example of its application to the calibration of silicon solid-state
detectors is shown in Fig. 11.15.</p>

<p><img src="tab1.3.png" width="546" height="837" alt=""></p>

<p>Because alpha particles lose energy rapidly in materials, alpha particle sources that are
to be nearly monoenergetic must be prepared in very thin layers. In order to contain the
radioactive material, typical sources are covered with a metallic foil or other material that
must also be kept very thin if the original energy and monoenergetic nature of the alpha
emission are to be preserved.</p>

<h3>B. Spontaneous Fission</h3>
The fission process is the only spontaneous source of energetic heavy charged particles
with mass greater than that of the alpha particle. Fission fragments are therefore widely
used in the calibration and testing of detectors intended for general application to heavy
ion measurements.

<p>All heavy nuclei are, in principle, unstable against spontaneous fission into two lighter
fragments. For all but the extremely heavy nuclei, however, the process is inhibited by the
large potential barrier that must be overcome in the distortion of the nucleus from its original
near-spherical shape. Spontaneous fission is therefore not a significant process except
for some transuranic isotopes of very large mass number. The most widely used example is
\(^{252}Cf\), which undergoes spontaneous fission with a half-life (if it were the only decay
process) of 85 years. However, most transuranic elements also undergo alpha decay, and in
\(^{252}Cf\) the probability for alpha emission is considerably higher than that for spontaneous
fission. Therefore, the actual half-life for this isotope is 2.65 years, and a sample of 1 microgram
of \(^{252}Cf\) will emit \(1.92 \times 10^{7}\) alpha particles and undergo \(6.14 \times 10^{5}\) spontaneous fissions
per second.</p>

<p>Each fission gives rise to two fission fragments, which, by the conservation of momentum,
are emitted in opposite directions. Because the normal physical form for a spontaneous
fission source is a thin deposit on a flat backing, only one fragment per fission can
escape from the surface, whereas the other is lost by absorption within the backing. As
described later in this chapter, each spontaneous fission in \(^{252}Cf\) also liberates a number of
fast neutrons.</p>

<p>The fission fragments are medium-weight positive ions with a mass distribution illustrated
in Fig. 1.4a The fission is predominantly asymmetric so that the fragments are clustered
into a "light group" and "heavy group," with average mass numbers of 108 and 143.
The fragments appear initially as positive ions for which the net charge approaches the
atomic number of the fragment. As the fragment slows down by interacting with the matter
through which it passes, additional electrons are picked up by the ion, reducing its effective
charge.</p>

<p><img src="fig1.4a.png" width="649" height="461" alt=""></p>

<p>The energy shared by the two fragments averages about \(185 MeV\). The distribution of
this energy is also asymmetric with the light fragment receiving the greater fraction. A plot
of their initial energy distribution is shown in Fig. 1.4b. Because they also lose energy readily
in solid materials, self-absorption and energy loss of the fragments are important considerations
unless the source is prepared in a very thin layer. The type of degradation of a
fission fragment energy spectrum observed from thicker sources (for the case of neutron-induced
\(^{235}U\) fission) is illustrated in Fig. 14.7</p>

<p><img src="fig1.4b.png" width="649" height="551" alt=""></p>

<h2>IV. SOURCES OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION</h2>
<h3>A. Gamma Rays Following Beta Decay</h3>
Gamma radiation is emitted by excited nuclei in their transition to lower-lying nuclear levels.
In most practical laboratory sources, the excited nuclear states are created in the decay
of a parent radionuclide. Four common examples widely used as gamma-ray calibration
sources are illustrated in the decay schemes in Fig. 1.5. In each case, a form of beta decay
leads to the population of the excited state in the daughter nucleus. For the examples
shown, the beta decay is a relatively slow process characterized by a half-life of hundreds
of days or greater, whereas the excited states in the daughter nucleus have a much shorter
average lifetime (typically of the order of picoseconds or less). De-excitation takes place
through the emission of a gamma-ray photon whose energy is essentially equal to the difference
in energy between the initial and final nuclear states. The gamma rays therefore
appear with a half-life characteristic of the parent beta decay but with an energy that
reflects the energy level structure of the daughter nucleus. For example, although "\(^{60}Co\)
 gamma rays" decrease in intensity with the 5.26-year half-life characteristic of \(^{60}Co\), they
actually arise from transitions in the \(^{60}Ni\) nucleus. Decay schemes of the type shown in
Fig. 1.5 are compiled for all radioactive nuclei in Ref. 1. From the probabilities of various
de-excitation transitions (or "branching ratios") given in these decay schemes, the number
of gamma-ray photons per disintegration of the parent nucleus can be deduced. Some
specific radionuclide gamma-ray sources useful in the precise energy calibration and efficiency
calibration of gamma-ray detectors are listed in Tables 12.1 and 12.2.

<p><img src="fig1.5.png" width="650" height="594" alt=""></p>

<p>Because nuclear states have very well-defined energies, the energies of gamma rays
emitted in state-to-state transitions are also very specific. The gamma rays from any one
transition are nearly monoenergetic, and the inherent line width of the photon energy distribution
is nearly always small compared with the energy resolution of any of the detectors
described later in this text. A measurement of the detector response is therefore
indicative of its own limiting resolution rather than any variation in the incident gammaray
energy.</p>

<p>The common gamma-ray sources based on beta decay are generally limited to energies
below about \(2.8 MeV\). One nuclide that can be useful as a potential source for gamma rays
of higher energy is \(^{56}Co\). The decay scheme of this isotope, which includes both electron
capture and pf decay, gives rise to a complex spectrum of gamma rays whose energies
extend to as high as \(3.55 MeV\). The short half-life of \(^{56}Co\) (77 days), however, largely limits
its use to facilities with access to accelerators necessary to carry out its production through
the \(^{56}Fe(p,n)\) reaction. Another possible radioisotope for high-energy calibrations is \(^{16}N\),
with gamma rays of \(6.13\) and \(7.11 MeV\) emitted through its \(\beta^{-}\) decay to \(^{16}O\). gain, the very
short half-life of just over 7 seconds requires the local production of this isotope in reactors
or accelerators, which can be employed with a continuous circulation loop to provide
a steady-state source of this radionuclide.</p>

<p>Gamma-ray reference sources are an essential accessory in any radiation measurements
laboratory in which gamma-ray measurements are carried out. They normally consist of samples
of radioisotopes of a few microcuries (around \(10^{5} Bq\)) encased in plastic disks or rods.
The thickness of the encapsulation is generally large enough to stop any particulate radiation
from the decay of the parent nucleus, and the only primary radiation emerging from the surface
is the gamma radiation produced in the daughter decay. However, secondary radiations
such as annihilation photons or bremsstrahlung can be significant at times (see below).
Although the radiation hazard of such sources is minimal, the gamma-ray emission rate is
sufficiently high to permit ready energy calibration of most types of gamma-ray detectors.</p>

<p>If the sources are to be used to carry out accurate efficiency calibration, their absolute
activity must also be known. In these cases, the radioisotope deposits are generally prepared
on much thinner backings with a minimum of overlying cover to reduce gamma-ray attenuation
and scattering within the source structure. External absorbers must then be used to
eliminate any particulate emission if its presence will interfere with the application.</p>

<h3>B. Annihilation Radiation</h3>
When the parent nucleus undergoes \(\beta^{+}\) decay, additional electromagnetic radiation is generated.
The origin lies in the fate of the positrons emitted in the primary decay process.
Because they generally travel only a few millimeters before losing their kinetic energy (see
Chapter 2), the inherent encapsulation around the source is often sufficiently thick to fully
stop the positrons. When their energy is very low, near the end of their range, they combine
with normal negative electrons in the absorbing materials in the process of <i>annihilation</i>.
The original positron and electron disappear and are replaced by two oppositely directed
\(0.511 MeV\) electromagnetic photons known as <i>annihilation radiation</i>. This radiation is then
superimposed on whatever gamma radiation may be emitted in the subsequent decay of
the daughter product. For example, in the decay of \(^{22}Na\), shown in Fig. 1.5, photons of both
\(0.511\) and \(1.274 MeV\) energy are emitted from encapsulated sources.

<h3>C. Gamma Rays Following Nuclear Reactions</h3>
If gamma rays with energies higher than those available from beta-active isotopes are
needed, some other process must lead to the population of higher-lying nuclear states. One
possibility is the nuclear reaction
\[
^{4}_{2}\alpha + ^{9}_{4}Be \rightarrow ^{12}_{6}C* + ^{1}_{0}n
\]

where the product nucleus \(^{12}C\) is left in an excited state. Its decay gives rise to a gamma-ray
photon of \(4.44 MeV\) energy. Unfortunately, the average lifetime of this state is so short
(\(61 fs\)) that the recoil carbon atom does not have time to come to rest before the gamma
ray is emitted. The resulting photon energies are therefore broadened by Doppler effects,
depending on the relative orientation of the recoil atom velocity and the photon direction,
and there is an inherent spread of about 1% in the gamma-ray energies. This line width is
adequate for many calibration purposes, but it is too large for detectors with very good
energy resolution (such as the germanium detectors of Chapter 12). Neutrons are also
emitted in this reaction, and the number of \(4.44 MeV\) gamma rays per neutron has been
measured to be about 0.59 for typical sources based on radioisotope alpha particle emitters
mixed with beryllium.

<p>Another possibility is the reaction
\[
^{4}_{2}\alpha + ^{13}_{6}C \rightarrow ^{16}_{8}O* + ^{1}_{0}n
\]

Here the product nucleus \(^{16}O\) can be formed in an excited state at \(6.130 MeV\) above the
ground state and with a lifetime of about \(2 \times 10^{-11} s\). This lifetime is sufficiently long to
eliminate almost all Doppler effects, and the resulting \(6.130 MeV\) gamma-ray photons are
essentially monoenergetic.</p>

<p>Both the above reactions can be exploited by combining a radioisotope that decays by
alpha emission with the appropriate target material (either \(^{9}Be\) or \(^{13}C\)). Because sources of
this type are more commonly used to produce neutrons, further discussion of the choice of
alpha emitter and other aspects of the source design will be postponed until the following
section on neutron sources. Because most alpha particles do not lead to a reaction before
losing their energy in the target material, large activities of the alpha emitter must be used
to produce a gamma-ray source of practical intensity. For example, a typical source fabricated
from \(6 \times 10^{9} Bq\) of \(^{238}PuO_{2}\) and \(200 mg\) of isotopically separated \(^{13}C\) produces a
\(6.130 MeV\) gamma-ray yield of \(770 \, photons/s\).</p>

<p>Gamma rays are also commonly emitted following the absorption of thermal neutrons
by typical nuclei. Sources of thermal neutrons used in the production of gamma rays can
be intense beams from nuclear reactors or accelerator facilities, or weaker fluxes from
moderated radioisotope sources of neutrons. These "neutron-capture gamma rays"
typically have energy ranging as high as \(9 MeV\), and data on the probabilities of emission
per neutron capture that can be useful for detector calibrations are available from various
sources (e.g., Ref. 13).</p>

<h3>D. Bremsstrahlung</h3>
When fast electrons interact in matter, part of their energy is converted into electromagnetic
radiation in the form of bremsstrahlung. (This process is discussed in somewhat more
detail in Chapter 2.) The fraction of the electron energy converted into bremsstrahlung
increases with increasing electron energy and is largest for absorbing materials of high
atomic number. The process is important in the production of X-rays from conventional
X-ray tubes.

<p>For monoenergetic electrons that slow down and stop in a given material, the
bremsstrahlung energy spectrum is a continuum with photon energies that extend as high as
the electron energy itself. The shape of a typical spectrum produced by monoenergetic electrons
is shown in Fig. 1.6. The emission of low-energy photons predominates, and the average
photon energy is a small fraction of the incident electron energy. Because these spectra are
continua, they cannot be applied directly to the energy calibration of radiation detectors.</p>

<p><img src="fig1.6.png" width="646" height="499" alt=""></p>

<p>The shape of the energy spectrum from an X-ray tube can be beneficially altered by
filtration or passage through appropriate absorber materials. Through the use of absorbers
that preferentially remove the lower-energy photons, a peaked spectrum can be produced
that, although far from monoenergetic, can be useful in the energy calibration of detectors
whose response changes only gradually with energy. Some examples of filtered spectra
from X-ray tubes are plotted in Fig. 1.7. At lower energies, the abrupt change in filter
transmission at its \(K\)-absorption edge (see Chapter 2) can produce a prominent peak at the
corresponding energy in the filtered spectrum.</p>

<p><img src="fig1.7.png" width="605" height="708" alt=""></p>

<p>Bremsstrahlung is also produced by other sources of fast electrons, including beta particles.
Therefore, some bremsstrahlung photons are generated by any beta-active isotope
encapsulated to stop the beta particles. Some examples of bremsstrahlung spectra from
specific isotopes are plotted in Fig. 10.5.</p>

<p>In addition to bremsstrahlung, characteristic X-rays (see following section) are also
produced when fast electrons pass through an absorber. Therefore, the spectra from X-ray
tubes or other bremsstrahlung sources also show characteristic X-ray emission lines superimposed
on the continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum.</p>

<h3>E. Characteristic X-Rays</h3>
If the orbital electrons in an atom are disrupted from their normal configuration by some
excitation process, the atom may exist in an excited state for a short period of time. There is
a natural tendency for the electrons to rearrange themselves to return the atom to its lowest
energy or ground state within a time that is characteristically a nanosecond or less in a solid
material.The energy liberated in the transition from the excited to the ground state takes the
form of a <i>characteristic X-ray</i> photon whose energy is given by the energy difference between
the initial and final states. For example, if the vacancy is temporarily created in the \(K\) shell of
an atom, then a characteristic <i>K X-ray</i> is liberated when that vacancy is subsequently filled.
If that electron comes from the \(L\) shell, then a \(K_{\alpha}\) photon is produced whose energy is equal
to the difference in binding energies between the \(K\) and \(L\) shells. If the filling electron
originated in the \(M\) shell instead, then a \(K_{\beta}\) photon is produced with slightly larger energy,
and so on. The maximum \(K\)-series photon is produced when the vacancy is filled by a free or
unbound electron, and the corresponding photon energy is then simply given by the \(K\) shell
binding energy. Vacancies created in outer shells by the filling of a K shell vacancy are subsequently
filled with the emission of \(L\text{-}\), \(M\text{-}\), . . . series characteristic X-rays.

<p>Because their energy is greatest, the \(K\)-series X-rays are generally of most practical
significance. Their energy increases regularly with atomic number of the element and is, for
example, about \(1 keV\) for sodium with \(Z = 11\), \(10 keV\) for gallium with \(Z = 31\), and
\(100 keV\) for radium with \(Z = 88\). The L series X-rays do not reach \(1 keV\) until \(Z = 28\) and
\(10 keV\) at \(Z = 74\). Extensive tables of precise characteristic X-rays can be found in Ref. 1.
Because the energy of the characteristic X-ray is unique to each individual element, they
are often used in the elemental analysis of unknown samples (see Fig. 13.17).</p>

<p>For an atom in an excited state, the ejection of an Auger electron is a competitive
process to the emission of characteristic X-rays. The <i>fluorescent yield</i> is defined as the fraction
of all cases in which the excited atom emits a characteristic X-ray photon in its
de-excitation. Values for the fluorescent yield are often tabulated as part of spectroscopic data.</p>

<p>A large number of different physical processes can lead to the population of excited
atomic states from which characteristic X-rays originate. In general, the relative yields of
the \(K\), \(L\), and subsequent series will depend on the excitation method, but the energy of the
characteristic photons is fixed by the basic atomic binding energies. We list below those
excitation mechanisms that are of most practical importance for compact laboratory
sources of characteristic X-rays.</p>

<h4>1. EXCITATION BY RADIOACTIVE DECAY</h4>
In the nuclear decay process of electron capture, the nuclear charge is decreased by one
unit by the capture of an orbital electron, most often a \(K\)-electron. The resulting atom still
has the right number of orbital electrons, but the capture process has created a vacancy in
one of the inner shells. When this vacancy is subsequently filled, X-rays are generated that
are characteristic of the product element. The decay may populate either the ground state
or an excited state in the product nucleus, so that the characteristic X-rays may also be
accompanied by gamma rays from subsequent nuclear de-excitation.

<p>Internal conversion is another nuclear process that can lead to characteristic X-rays.
As defined earlier in this chapter, internal conversion results in the ejection of an orbital
electron from the atom leaving behind a vacancy. Again, it is the \(K\)-electrons that are most
readily converted, and therefore the \(K\)-series characteristic X-rays are the most prominent.
Because gamma-ray de-excitation of the nuclear state is always a competing process to
internal conversion, radioisotope sources of this type usually emit gamma rays in addition
to the characteristic X-rays. The conversion electrons may also lead to a measurable
bremsstrahlung continuum, particularly when their energy is high.</p>

<p>In Table 13.2, some examples are given of radioisotopes that involve either electron
capture or internal conversion and are possible sources of characteristic X-rays. In all these
examples, the yield of high-energy gamma rays from a nuclear transition is large compared
with that of the characteristic X-rays. If a pure X-ray source free of gamma-ray contamination
is required, a radioisotope that decays by electron capture leading directly to the
ground nuclear state of the daughter must be chosen.Table 1.4 gives some examples for the
lower energy range. Of these, \(^{55}Fe\) is most widely used because of its convenient half-life
and high available specific activity. It is very nearly a pure source of manganese \(K\)-series
X-rays at about \(5.9 keV\), and the inner bremsstrahlung associated with the electron capture
process is very weak.</p>

<p><img src="tab1.4.png" width="653" height="278" alt=""></p>

<p>Self-absorption is a significant technical problem in the preparation of radioisotope
X-ray sources. As the thickness of the radioisotope deposit is increased, the X-ray flux
emerging from its surface approaches a limiting value because only those atoms near the
surface can contribute photons that escape. The number of emitting atoms within a given
distance of the deposit surface is maximized by increasing the specific activity of the
radioisotope, and carrier-free samples will exhibit the maximum attainable source intensity
per unit area.</p>

<h4>2. EXCITATION BY EXTERNAL RADIATION</h4>
The general scheme sketched in Fig. 1.8 may also be used to generate characteristic
X-rays. Here an external source of radiation (X-rays, electrons, alpha particles, etc.) is
caused to strike a target, creating excited or ionized atoms in the target through the
processes detailed in Chapter 2. Because many excited atoms or ions in the target subsequently
de-excite to the ground state through the emission of characteristic X-rays, the target
can serve as a localized source of these X-rays.

<p><img src="fig1.8.png" width="650" height="190" alt=""></p>

<p>The energy of the X-rays emitted depends on the choice of target material. Targets
with low atomic number result in soft characteristic X-rays, and high-\(Z\) targets produce
harder or higher energy X-rays. The incident radiation must have a higher energy than the
maximum photon energy expected from the target, because the excited states leading to
the corresponding atomic transition must be populated by the incident radiation.</p>

<p>As one example, the incident radiation may consist of X-rays generated in a conventional
X-ray tube. These X-rays may then interact in the target through photoelectric
absorption, and the subsequent de-excitation of the target ions creates their characteristic
X-ray spectrum. In this case, the process is called X-ray fluorescence. Although the characteristic
X-ray spectrum can be contaminated by scattered photons from the incident X-ray
beam, this component can be kept below about 10 or 20% of the total photon yield with
proper choice of target and geometry.</p>

<p>As an alternative to bulky X-ray tubes, radioisotopes that emit low-energy photons
may also be used as the source of the excitation. An example is \(^{241}Am\), in which gamma
rays of \(60 keV\) energy are emitted in 36% of the decays. Characteristic X-ray sources using
this isotope for excitation of targets in the geometry shown in Fig. 1.9 are currently available
using up to \(10 mCi\) of \(^{241}Am\) activity.</p>

<p><img src="fig1.9.png" width="651" height="281" alt=""></p>

<p>Another method of exciting the target is through the use of an external electron beam.
For targets of low atomic number, acceleration potentials of only a few thousand volts are
required so that relatively compact electron sources can be devised. In the case of electron
excitation, the characteristic X-ray spectrum from the target will be contaminated by the
continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum also generated by interactions of the incident electrons
in the target. For thin targets, however, the bremsstrahlung photons are preferentially
emitted in the forward direction, whereas the characteristic X-rays are emitted isotropically.
 Placing the exit window at a large angle (\(120-180^{\circ}\)) with respect to the incident
electron direction will therefore minimize the bremsstrahlung contamination.</p>

<p>The incident radiation in Fig. 1.8 can also consist of heavy charged particles. Again, the
interactions of these particles in the target will give rise to the excited atoms necessary for
the emission of characteristic X-rays. For compact and portable sources, alpha particles
emitted by radioisotope sources are the most convenient source of the incident particles.
Of the various potential alpha emitters, the most useful are \(^{210}Po\) and \(^{244}Cm\) because of their
(see Table 1.5). Alpha particle excitation avoids the complication of bremsstrahlung associated
convenient half-lives and relative freedom from contaminant electromagnetic radiation
with electron excitation and is therefore capable of generating a relatively "clean"
characteristic X-ray spectrum. A cross-sectional diagram of a typical source of this type is
shown in Fig. 1.9. The X-ray yields into one steradian solid angle per \(mC\)i (\(37 MBq\)) of
\(^{244}Cm\) ranges from \(1.7 \times 10^{5} \, photons/s\) for a beryllium target to about \(10^{4} \, photons/
second\) for targets of higher \(Z\) (Ref. 17).</p>

<h3>E Synchrotron Radiation</h3>
Another form of radiation is produced when a beam of energetic electrons is bent into a circular
orbit. From electromagnetic theory, a small fraction of the beam energy is radiated
away during each cycle of the beam. Originally considered to be something of a nuisance by
high-energy accelerator designers, this synchrotron radiation has turned out over the past
several decades to be a very useful form of electromagnetic radiation. When extracted from
the accelerator in a tangential direction to the beam orbit, the radiation appears as an intense
and highly directional beam of photons with energy that can span the range from visible light
(a few \(eV\)) through X-ray energies (\( \sim 10^{4} eV\)). Monochromators can be used to produce
nearly monoenergetic photon beams with a very high intensity. A number of high-energy
accelerators (typically producing electrons with energy of \(500 MeV\) or more) have since been
built that are dedicated to the production of synchrotron radiation. Although limited to
large-scale centralized user facilities, this unique form of electromagnetic radiation has
proven to be very useful because of the high intensity and tunable energy of the available
source.

<h2>V. NEUTRON SOURCES</h2>
Although nuclei created with excitation energy greater than the neutron binding energy
can decay by neutron emission, these highly excited states are not produced as a result of
any convenient radioactive decay process. Consequently, practical isotope sources of neutrons
do not exist in the same sense that gamma-ray sources are available from many different
nuclei populated by beta decay. The possible choices for radioisotope neutron
sources are much more limited and are based on either spontaneous fission or on nuclear
reactions for which the incident particle is the product of a conventional decay process.

<h3>A. Spontaneous Fission</h3>
Many of the transuranic heavy nuclides have an appreciable spontaneous fission decay
probability. Several fast neutrons are promptly emitted in each fission event, so a sample
of such a radionuclide can be a simple and convenient isotopic neutron source. Other products
of the fission process are the heavy fission products described earlier, prompt fission
gamma rays, and the beta and gamma activity of the fission products accumulated within
the sample. When used as a neutron source, the isotope is generally encapsulated in a sufficiently
thick container so that only the fast neutrons and gamma rays emerge from the
source.

<p>The most common spontaneous fission source is \(^{252}Cf\). Its half-life of 2.65 years is long
enough to be reasonably convenient, and the isotope is one of the most widely produced
of all the transuranics. The dominant decay mechanism is alpha decay, and the alpha emission
rate is about 32 times that for spontaneous fission. The neutron yield is \(0.116 n/s\) per
\(Bq\), where the activity is the combined alpha and spontaneous fission decay rate. On a unit
mass basis, \(2.30 \times 10^{6} n/s\) are produced per microgram of the sample. Compared with the
other isotopic neutron sources described below, \(^{252}Cf\) sources involve very small amounts
of active material (normally of the order of micrograms) and can therefore be made in very
small sizes dictated only by the encapsulation requirements.</p>

<p>The energy spectrum of the neutrons is plotted in Fig. 1.10. The spectrum is peaked
between \(0.5\) and \(1 MeV\), although a significant yield of neutrons extends to as high as \(8\) or
\(10 MeV\). The shape of a typical fission spectrum is approximated by the expression
\[
\frac{dN}{dE} = E^{1/2}e^{-E/T} \tag{1.6}
\]

For the spontaneous fission of \(^{252}Cf\), the constant \(T\) in Eq. (1.6) has a value of \(1.3 MeV\)
(Ref. 19). In addition to about 3.8 neutrons on average, each fission in \(^{252}Cf\) also results in
an average of about 9.7 emitted gamma-ray photons. Most of these (> 85%) are relatively
high-energy prompt gamma rays that are emitted within the first nanosecond following
the fission event.</p>

<p><img src="fig1.10.png" width="570" height="429" alt=""></p>

<h3>B. Radioisotope \((\alpha,n)\) Sources</h3>
Because energetic alpha particles are available from the direct decay of a number of convenient
radionuclides, it is possible to fabricate a small self-contained neutron source by
mixing an alpha-emitting isotope with a suitable target material. Several different target
materials can lead to \((\alpha,n)\) reactions for the alpha particle energies that are readily available
in radioactive decay. The maximum neutron yield is obtained when beryllium is chosen
as the target, and neutrons are produced through the reaction
\[
^{4}_{2}\alpha + ^{9}_{4}Be \rightarrow ^{12}_{6}C + ^{1}_{0}n
\]

which has a \(Q\)-value of \(+5.71 MeV\).

<p>The neutron yield from this reaction when a beam of alpha particles strikes a target
that is thick compared with their range is plotted in Fig. 1.11. Most of the alpha particles
simply are stopped in the target, and only 1 in about \(10^{4}\) reacts with a beryllium nucleus.
Virtually the same yield can be obtained from an intimate mixture of the alpha particle
emitter and beryllium, provided the alpha emitter is homogeneously distributed throughout
the beryllium in a small relative concentration. All the alpha emitters of practical interest
are actinide elements, and investigations have shown that a stable alloy can be formed
between the actinides and beryllium of the form \(MBe_{13}\), where \(M\) represents the actinide
metal. Most of the sources described below therefore are metallurgically prepared in the
form of this alloy, and each alpha particle has an opportunity to interact with beryllium
nuclei without any intermediate energy loss.</p>

<p><img src="fig1.11.png" width="527" height="425" alt=""></p>

<p>Some of the common choices for alpha emitters and properties of the resulting neutron
sources are listed in Table 1.6. Several of these isotopes, notably \(^{226}Ra\) and \(^{227}Ac\), lead
to long chains of daughter products that, although adding to the alpha particle yield, also
contribute a large gamma-ray background. These sources are therefore inappropriate for
some applications in which the intense gamma-ray background interferes with the measurement.
Also, these \(Ra\text{-}Be\) and \(Ac\text{-}Be\) sources require more elaborate handling procedures
because of the added biological hazard of the gamma radiation.</p>

<p><img src="tab1.6.png" width="654" height="409" alt=""></p>

<p>The remaining radioisotopes in Table 1.6 involve simpler alpha decays and the gammaray
background is much lower. The choice between these alternatives is made primarily on
the basis of availability, cost, and half-life. Because the physical size of the sources is no
longer negligible, one would like the half-life to be as short as possible, consistent with the
application, so that the specific activity of the emitter is high.</p>

<p>The \(^{239}Pu/Be\) source is probably the most widely used of the \((\alpha, n)\) isotopic neutron
sources. However, because about \(16 g\) of the material is required for \(1 Ci (3.7 \times 10^{10} Bq)\)
of activity, sources of this type of a few centimeters in dimension are limited to about
\(10^{7} n/s\). In order to increase the neutron yield without increasing the physical source size,
alpha emitters with higher specific activities must be substituted. Therefore, sources incorporating
\(^{241}Am\) (half-life of 433 years) and \(^{238}Pu\)(half-life of 87.4 years) are also widely
used if high neutron yields are needed. Sources utilizing \(^{244}Cm\) (half-life of 18 years) represent
a near ideal compromise between specific activity and source lifetime, but the isotope
is not always widely available.</p>

<p>The neutron energy spectra from all such alpha/Be sources are similar, and any differences
reflect only the small variations in the primary alpha energies. A plot of the spectrum
from a \(^{239}Pu/Be\) source is shown in Fig. 1.12. The various peaks and valleys in this
energy distribution can be analyzed in terms of the excitation state in which the \(^{12}C\) product
nucleus is left. The alpha particles lose a variable amount of energy before reacting
with a beryllium nucleus, however, and their continuous energy distribution washes out
much of the structure that would be observed if the alpha particles were monoenergetic.
For sources that contain only a few grams of material, the spectrum of neutrons that
emerges from the source surface is essentially the same as that created in the \((\alpha,n )\) reactions.
For larger sources, the secondary processes of neutron scattering within the source,
\((n, 2n)\) reactions in beryllium, and \((n, fission)\) events within the plutonium or other actinide
can introduce some dependence of the energy spectrum on the source size.</p>

<p><img src="fig1.12.png" width="646" height="331" alt=""></p>

<p>Because large activities of the actinide isotope are involved in these neutron sources,
special precautions must be taken in their fabrication to ensure that the material remains
safely encapsulated. The actinide-beryllium alloy is usually sealed within two individually
welded stainless steel cylinders in the arrangement shown in Fig. 1.13. Some expansion
space must be allowed within the inner cylinder to accommodate the slow evolution of
helium gas formed when the alpha particles are stopped and neutralized.</p>

<p><img src="fig1.13.png" width="558" height="190" alt=""></p>

<p>When applied to the efficiency calibration of detectors, some caution must be used in
assuming that the neutron yield for these sources decays exactly as the half-life of the principal
actinide alpha emitter. Small amounts of contaminant alpha activity, present in either
the original radioisotope sample or produced through the decay of a precursor, can influence
the overall neutron yield. For example, many \(^{239}Pu/Be\) sources have been prepared
from plutonium containing small amounts of other plutonium isotopes. The isotope 241P~
is particularly significant, because it beta decays with a half-life of 13.2 years to form
\(^{241}Am\), an alpha emitter. The neutron yield of these sources can therefore gradually
increase with time as the \(^{241}Am\) accumulates in the source. An original \(^{241}Pu\) isotopic fraction
of 0.7% will result in an initial growth rate of the neutron yield of 2% per year</p>

<p>A number of other alpha-particle-induced reactions have occasionally been employed
as neutron sources, but all have a substantially lower neutron yield per unit alpha activity
compared with the beryllium reaction. Some of the potential useful reactions are listed in
Table 1.7. Because all the \(Q\)-values of these reactions are less than that of the beryllium
reaction, the resulting neutron spectra shown in Fig 1.14 have a somewhat lower average
energy. In particular, the \(^{7}Li (\alpha,n )\) reaction with its highly negative \(Q\)-value leads to a neutron
spectrum with a low \(0.5 MeV\) average energy that is especially useful in some applications.
Details of this spectrum shape are given in Ref. 28.</p>

<p><img src="tab1.7.png" width="653" height="260" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="fig1.14.png" width="653" height="381" alt=""></p>

<h3>C. Photoneutron Sources</h3>
Some radioisotope gamma-ray emitters can also be used to produce neutrons when combined
with an appropriate target material. The resulting photoneutron sources are based on supplying
sufficient excitation energy to a target nucleus by absorption of a gamma-ray photon to allow
the emission of a free neutron. Only two target nuclei, \(^{9}Be\) and \(^{2}H\), are of any practical significance
for radioisotope photoneutron sources. The corresponding reactions can be written
<table align="center" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>\(Q{\rm \text{-}value}\)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(^{9}_{4}Be + h\nu \rightarrow ^{8}_{4}Be + ^{1}_{0}n\)</td>
<td>\(-1.666MeV\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>\(^{2}_{1}H + h\nu \rightarrow ^{1}_{1}H + ^{1}_{0}n\)</td>
<td>\(-2.226MeV\)</td>
</tr>
</table>

A gamma-ray photon with an energy of at least the negative of the \(Q\)-value is required to
make the reactions energetically possible, so that only relatively high-energy gamma rays
can be applied. For gamma-ray energies that exceed this minimum, the corresponding neutron
energy can be calculated from
\[
E_{n}(\theta) \cong \frac{M(E_{\gamma} + Q)}{m + M} + \frac{E_{\gamma}[(2mM)(m + M)(E_{\gamma}Q]^{1/2}}{(m + M)^{2}}\cos \theta \tag{1.7}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
\theta &=& {\rm angle \, between \, gamma \, photon \, and \, neutron \, direction} \\
E_{\gamma} &=& {\rm gamma \, energy \, (assumed} \ll 931 MeV) \\
M &=& {\rm mass \, of \, recoil \, nucleus\, } \times c^{2} \\
m &=& {\rm mass \, of \, neutron \, } \times c^{2}
\end{eqnarray}

<p>One decided advantage of photoneutron sources is that if the gamma rays are monoenergetic,
the neutrons are also nearly monoenergetic. The relatively small kinematic spread
obtained from Eq. (1.7) by letting the angle \(\theta\) vary between 0 and \(\pi\) broadens the neutron
energy spectrum by only a few percent. For large sources, the spectrum is also somewhat
degraded by the scattering of some neutrons within the source before their escape.</p>

<p>The main disadvantage of photoneutron sources is the fact that very large gamma-ray
activities must be used in order to produce neutron sources of attractive intensity. For the
type of source sketched in Fig. 1.15, only about 1 gamma ray in \(10^{5}\) or \(10^{6}\) interacts to produce
a neutron, and therefore the neutrons appear in a much more intense gamma-ray
background. Some of the more common gamma-ray emitters are \(^{226}Ra\), \(^{124}Sb\), \(^{72}Ga\), \(^{140}La\),
and \(^{24}Na\). Some properties and energy spectra of corresponding photoneutron sources are
shown in Table 1.8 and Fig. 1.16. For many of these sources, the half-lives of the gamma emitters
are short enough to require their reactivation in a nuclear reactor between uses</p>

<h3>D. Reactions from Accelerated Charged Particles</h3>
Because alpha particles are the only heavy charged particles with low \(Z\) conveniently available
from radioisotopes, reactions involving incident protons, deuterons, and so on must
rely on artificially accelerated particles. Two of the most common reactions of this type
used to produce neutrons are
<table align="center" cellpadding="10">
<tr><td></td><td></td><td>\(Q\)-value</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>The \(D\)-\(D\) reaction</td>
<td>\(^{2}_{1}H + ^{2}_{1}H \rightarrow ^{3}_{2}He + ^{1}_{0}n\)</td>
<td>\(+3.26 MeV\)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The \(D\)-\(T\) reaction</td>
<td>\(^{2}_{1}H + ^{3}_{1}H \rightarrow ^{4}_{2}He + ^{1}_{0}n\)</td>
<td>\(+17.6 MeV\)</td>
</tr>
</table>

Because the coulomb barrier between the incident deuteron and the light target nucleus is
relatively small, the deuterons need not be accelerated to a very high energy in order to
create a significant neutron yield. These reactions are widely exploited in "neutron generators"
in which deuterium ions are accelerated by a potential of about \(100\)ー\(300 kV\). Because
the incident particle energy is then small compared with the \(Q\)-value of either reaction, all
the neutrons produced have about the same energy (near \(3 MeV\) for the \(D\text{-}D\) reaction and
\(14 MeV\) for the \(D\text{-}T\) reaction). A \(1 mA\) beam of deuterons will produce about \(10^{9} n/s\) from
a thick deuterium target, and about \(10^{11} n/s\) from a tritium target. Somewhat smaller yields
are produced in compact neutron generators consisting of a sealed tube containing the ion
source and target, together with a portable high-voltage generator.

<p>A number of other charged-particle-induced reactions that involve either a negative
\(Q\)-value or a target with higher atomic number are also applied to neutron generation.
Some common examples are \(^{9}Be(d, n)\), \(^{7}Li(p, n)\), and \(^{3}H(p, n)\). In these cases, a higher incident
particle energy is required, and large accelerator facilities such as cyclotrons or Van
de Graaf accelerators are needed to produce the incident particle beam.</p>
