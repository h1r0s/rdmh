<h1>General Properties of Radiation Detectors</h1>
Before discussing the different types of radiation detectors individually, we first outline
some general properties that apply to all types. Included will be some basic definitions of
detector properties, such as efficiency and energy resolution, together with some general
modes of operation and methods of recording data that will be helpful in categorizing
detector applications.

<h2>I. SIMPLIFIED DETECTOR MODEL</h2>
We begin with a hypothetical detector that is subject to some type of irradiation. Attention
is first focused on the interaction of a single particle or quantum of radiation in the detector,
which might, for example, be a single alpha particle or an individual gamma-ray photon.
In order for the detector to respond at all, the radiation must undergo interaction
through one of the mechanisms discussed in Chapter 2. As indicated by Eq. (2.3), the interaction
or stopping time is very small (typically a few nanoseconds in gases or a few
picoseconds in solids). In most practical situations, these times are so short that the deposition
of the radiation energy can be considered instantaneous.

<p>The net result of the radiation interaction in a wide category of detectors is the appearance
of a given amount of electric charge within the detector active volume. Our simplified
detector model thus assumes that a charge \(Q\) appears within the detector at time
\(t = 0\) resulting from the interaction of a single particle or quantum of radiation. Next, this
charge must be collected to form the basic electrical signal. Typically, collection of the
charge is accomplished through the imposition of an electric field within the detector,
which causes the positive and negative charges created by the radiation to flow in
opposite directions. The time required to fully collect the charge varies greatly from one
detector to another. For example, in ion chambers the collection time can be as long
as a few milliseconds, whereas in semiconductor diode detectors the time is a few nanoseconds.
These times reflect both the mobility of the charge carriers within the detector active
volume and the average distance that must be traveled before arrival at the collection
electrodes.</p>

<p>We therefore begin with a model of a prototypical detector whose response to a single
particle or quantum of radiation will be a current that flows for a time equal to the charge
collection time. The sketch below illustrates one example for the time dependence the
detector current might assume, where \(t_c\) represents the charge collection time.</p>

</tr>
</table>

The time integral over the duration of the current must simply be equal to \(Q\), the total
amount of charge generated in that specific interaction.

<p>In any real situation, many quanta of radiation will interact over a period of time. If the
irradiation rate is high, situations can arise in which current is flowing in the detector from
more than one interaction at a given time. For purposes of the present discussion, we
assume that the rate is low enough so that each individual interaction gives rise to a current
that is distinguishable from all others. The magnitude and duration of each current
pulse may vary depending on the type of interaction, and a sketch of the instantaneous current
flowing in the detector might then appear as shown in the sketch below.</p>

It is important to recall that, because the arrival of radiation quanta is a random phenomenon
governed by Poisson statistics, the time intervals between successive current pulses
are also randomly distributed.
