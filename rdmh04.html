<h1>General Properties of Radiation Detectors</h1>
Before discussing the different types of radiation detectors individually, we first outline
some general properties that apply to all types. Included will be some basic definitions of
detector properties, such as efficiency and energy resolution, together with some general
modes of operation and methods of recording data that will be helpful in categorizing
detector applications.

<h2>I. SIMPLIFIED DETECTOR MODEL</h2>
We begin with a hypothetical detector that is subject to some type of irradiation. Attention
is first focused on the interaction of a single particle or quantum of radiation in the detector,
which might, for example, be a single alpha particle or an individual gamma-ray photon.
In order for the detector to respond at all, the radiation must undergo interaction
through one of the mechanisms discussed in Chapter 2. As indicated by Eq. (2.3), the interaction
or stopping time is very small (typically a few nanoseconds in gases or a few
picoseconds in solids). In most practical situations, these times are so short that the deposition
of the radiation energy can be considered instantaneous.

<p>The net result of the radiation interaction in a wide category of detectors is the appearance
of a given amount of electric charge within the detector active volume. Our simplified
detector model thus assumes that a charge \(Q\) appears within the detector at time
\(t = 0\) resulting from the interaction of a single particle or quantum of radiation. Next, this
charge must be collected to form the basic electrical signal. Typically, collection of the
charge is accomplished through the imposition of an electric field within the detector,
which causes the positive and negative charges created by the radiation to flow in
opposite directions. The time required to fully collect the charge varies greatly from one
detector to another. For example, in ion chambers the collection time can be as long
as a few milliseconds, whereas in semiconductor diode detectors the time is a few nanoseconds.
These times reflect both the mobility of the charge carriers within the detector active
volume and the average distance that must be traveled before arrival at the collection
electrodes.</p>

<p>We therefore begin with a model of a prototypical detector whose response to a single
particle or quantum of radiation will be a current that flows for a time equal to the charge
collection time. The sketch below illustrates one example for the time dependence the
detector current might assume, where \(t_c\) represents the charge collection time.</p>

<table cellpadding="10">

<td align="center">\[\int_0^{t_c}i(t)dt = Q\]</td>
</tr>
</table>

The time integral over the duration of the current must simply be equal to \(Q\), the total
amount of charge generated in that specific interaction.

<p>In any real situation, many quanta of radiation will interact over a period of time. If the
irradiation rate is high, situations can arise in which current is flowing in the detector from
more than one interaction at a given time. For purposes of the present discussion, we
assume that the rate is low enough so that each individual interaction gives rise to a current
that is distinguishable from all others. The magnitude and duration of each current
pulse may vary depending on the type of interaction, and a sketch of the instantaneous current
flowing in the detector might then appear as shown in the sketch below.</p>

<p><img src="noname4.2.png" width="387" height="125" alt=""></p>

It is important to recall that, because the arrival of radiation quanta is a random phenomenon
governed by Poisson statistics, the time intervals between successive current pulses
are also randomly distributed.

<h2>II. MODES OF DETECTOR OPERATION</h2>
We can now introduce a fundamental distinction between three general modes of operation
of radiation detectors. The three modes are called <i>pulse mode</i>, <i>current mode</i>, and <i>mean
square voltage mode</i> (abbreviated <i>MSV mode</i>, or sometimes called <i>Campbelling mode</i>).
Pulse mode is easily the most commonly applied of these, but current mode also finds many
applications. MSV mode is limited to some specialized applications that make use of its
unique characteristics. Although the three modes are operationally distinct, they are interrelated
through their common dependence on the sequence of current pulses that are the
output of our simplified detector model.

<p>In pulse mode operation, the measurement instrumentation is designed to record each
individual quantum of radiation that interacts in the detector. In most common applications,
the time integral of each burst of current, or the total charge \(Q\), is recorded since the
energy deposited in the detector is directly related to \(Q\). All detectors used to measure the
energy of individual radiation quanta must be operated in pulse mode. Such applications
are categorized as <i>radiation spectroscopy</i> and are the subject of much of the remainder of
this text.</p>

<p>In other circumstances, a simpler approach may suit the needs of the measurement: All
pulses above a low-level threshold are registered from the detector, regardless of the value
of \(Q\). This approach is often called <i>pulse counting</i>, and we will show various examples later
in this text. It can be useful in many applications in which only the intensity of the radiation
is of interest, rather than sensing any changes in or information about the incident
energy distribution of the radiation.</p>

<p>At very high event rates, pulse mode operation becomes impractical or even impossible.
The time between adjacent events may become too short to carry out an adequate
analysis, or the current pulses from successive events may overlap in time. In such cases,
one can revert to alternative measurement techniques that respond to the time average
taken over many individual events. This approach leads to the remaining two modes of
operation: current mode and MSV mode.</p>

<h3>A. Current Mode</h3>
In the sketch below, we show a current-measuring device (an ammeter or, more practically,
a picoammeter) connected across the output terminals of a radiation detector.

<p><img src="noname4.3.png" width="395" height="249" alt=""></p>

<p>If we assume that the measuring device has a fixed response time \(T\), then the recorded
signal from a sequence of events will be a time-dependent current given by
\[
I(t) = \frac{1}{T}\int_{t - T}^t i(t')dt' \tag{4.1}
\]

Because the response time \(T\) is typically long compared with the average time between
individual current pulses from the detector, the effect is to average out many of the fluctuations
in the intervals between individual radiation interactions and to record an average
current that depends on the product of the interaction rate and the charge per interaction.
In current mode, this time average of the individual current bursts serves as the basic signal
that is recorded.</p>

<p>At any instant of time, however, there is a statistical uncertainty in this signal due to the
random fluctuations in the arrival time of the event. In many ways, the integration time \(T\) is
analogous to the measurement time discussed in the statistical analysis of the previous chapter.
Thus, the choice of large \(T\) will minimize statistical fluctuations in the signal but will also
slow the response to rapid changes in the rate or nature of the radiation interactions.</p>

<p>The <i>average</i> current is given by the product of the average event rate and the charge
produced per event.
\[
I_0 = rQ = r\frac{E}{W}q \tag{4.2}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
r &=& {\rm event \, rate}\\
Q &=& Eq/W = {\rm charge \, produced \, for \, each \, event}\\
E &=& {\rm average \, energy \, deposited \, per \, event}\\
W &=& {\rm average \, energy \, required \, to \, produce \, a \, unit \, charge \, pair (e.g., electron\text{-}ion \, pair)}\\
q &=& 1.6 \times 10^{-19}C
\end{eqnarray}
</p>

<p>For steady-state irradiation of the detector, this average current can also be rewritten
as the sum of a constant current \(I\). plus a time-dependent fluctuating component \(\sigma_i(t)\), as
sketched below.</p>

<p><img src="noname4.4.png" width="321" height="169" alt=""></p>

Here \(\sigma_i(t)\) is a random time-dependent variable that occurs as a consequence of the random
nature of the radiation events interacting within the detector.

<p>A statistical measure of this random component is the variance or mean square value,
defined as the time average of the square of the difference between the fluctuating current
\(I(t)\) and the average current \(I_0\). This mean square value is given by
\[
\overline{\sigma_I^2(t)} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{t - T}^t[I(t') - I_0]^2 dt' = \frac{1}{T}\sigma_i^2(t')dt' \tag{4.3}
\]

and the standard deviation follows as
\[
\overline{\sigma_I(t)} = \sqrt{\overline{\sigma_I^2(t)}} \tag{4.4}
\]

<p>Recall from Poisson statistics that the standard deviation in the number of recorded
events \(n\) over a given observation period is expected to be
\[
\sigma_n = \sqrt{n} \tag{4.5}
\]

Therefore, the standard deviation in the number of events occurring at a rate \(r\) in an effective
measurement time \(T\) is simply
\[
\sigma_n = \sqrt{rT} \tag{4.6}
\]

If each pulse contributes the same charge, the <i>fractional</i> standard deviation in the measured
signal due to random fluctuations in pulse arrival time is given by
\[
\frac{\overline{\sigma_i(t)}}{I_0} = \frac{\sigma_n}{n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{rT}} \tag{4.7}
\]
</p>

<p>It should be noted that, in the derivation of Eq. (4.7), the charge produced in each
event (\(Q\)) is assumed to be constant. Therefore, the result accounts for only the random
fluctuations in pulse arrival time, but not for fluctuations in pulse amplitude. In some applications,
however, this second source of variance in the signal is small in comparison with
the first, and the general character of the results given remains applicable.</p>

<h3>B. Mean Square Voltage Mode</h3>
An extension of this discussion of the statistical properties of the signal in current mode
leads us to the next general mode of operation: the mean square voltage (MSV) mode.
Suppose that we send the current signal through a circuit element that blocks the average
current \(I\). and only passes the fluctuating component \(\sigma_i(t)\). By providing additional signal-processing
elements, we now compute the time average of the squared amplitude of \|\sigma_i(t)\).
(The details of these circuits are not important here; for further discussion see Ref. 2.) The
processing steps are illustrated below:

<p><img src="noname4.5.png" width="490" height="62" alt=""></p>

The result corresponds to the quantity \(\overline{\sigma_I^2(t)}\) defined previously in Eq. (4.3). Combining
Eqs. (4.2) and (4.7), we predict the magnitude of the signal derived in this way to be
\[
\overline{\sigma_I^2(t)} = \frac{rQ^2}{T} \tag{4.8}
\]

We see that this mean square signal is directly proportional to the event rate \(r\) and, more
significantly, proportional to the square of the charge \(Q\) produced in each event. An analysis
of this mode of operation was first given by Campbell and the term <i>Campbelling mode</i>
is therefore substituted for MSV mode in some usage.

<p>The MSV mode of operation is most useful when making measurements in mixed
radiation environments when the charge produced by one type of radiation is much different
than that from the second type. If simple current mode operation is chosen, the
measured current will linearly reflect the charges contributed by each type. In MSV mode,
however, the derived signal is proportional to the square of the charge per event. This operational
mode will therefore further weight the detector response in favor of the type of
radiation giving the larger average charge per event. As one example of the useful application
of the MSV mode, in Chapter 14 we describe its use with neutron detectors in reactor
instrumentation to enhance the neutron signal compared with the response due to
smaller-amplitude gamma-ray events.</p>
