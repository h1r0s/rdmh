<h1>General Properties of Radiation Detectors</h1>
Before discussing the different types of radiation detectors individually, we first outline
some general properties that apply to all types. Included will be some basic definitions of
detector properties, such as efficiency and energy resolution, together with some general
modes of operation and methods of recording data that will be helpful in categorizing
detector applications.

<h2>I. SIMPLIFIED DETECTOR MODEL</h2>
We begin with a hypothetical detector that is subject to some type of irradiation. Attention
is first focused on the interaction of a single particle or quantum of radiation in the detector,
which might, for example, be a single alpha particle or an individual gamma-ray photon.
In order for the detector to respond at all, the radiation must undergo interaction
through one of the mechanisms discussed in Chapter 2. As indicated by Eq. (2.3), the interaction
or stopping time is very small (typically a few nanoseconds in gases or a few
picoseconds in solids). In most practical situations, these times are so short that the deposition
of the radiation energy can be considered instantaneous.

<p>The net result of the radiation interaction in a wide category of detectors is the appearance
of a given amount of electric charge within the detector active volume. Our simplified
detector model thus assumes that a charge \(Q\) appears within the detector at time
\(t = 0\) resulting from the interaction of a single particle or quantum of radiation. Next, this
charge must be collected to form the basic electrical signal. Typically, collection of the
charge is accomplished through the imposition of an electric field within the detector,
which causes the positive and negative charges created by the radiation to flow in
opposite directions. The time required to fully collect the charge varies greatly from one
detector to another. For example, in ion chambers the collection time can be as long
as a few milliseconds, whereas in semiconductor diode detectors the time is a few nanoseconds.
These times reflect both the mobility of the charge carriers within the detector active
volume and the average distance that must be traveled before arrival at the collection
electrodes.</p>

<p>We therefore begin with a model of a prototypical detector whose response to a single
particle or quantum of radiation will be a current that flows for a time equal to the charge
collection time. The sketch below illustrates one example for the time dependence the
detector current might assume, where \(t_c\) represents the charge collection time.</p>

<table cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="noname4.1.png" width="189" height="99" alt=""></td>
<td align="center">\[\int_0^{t_c}i(t)dt = Q\]</td>
</tr>
</table>

The time integral over the duration of the current must simply be equal to \(Q\), the total
amount of charge generated in that specific interaction.

<p>In any real situation, many quanta of radiation will interact over a period of time. If the
irradiation rate is high, situations can arise in which current is flowing in the detector from
more than one interaction at a given time. For purposes of the present discussion, we
assume that the rate is low enough so that each individual interaction gives rise to a current
that is distinguishable from all others. The magnitude and duration of each current
pulse may vary depending on the type of interaction, and a sketch of the instantaneous current
flowing in the detector might then appear as shown in the sketch below.</p>

<p><img src="noname4.2.png" width="387" height="125" alt=""></p>

It is important to recall that, because the arrival of radiation quanta is a random phenomenon
governed by Poisson statistics, the time intervals between successive current pulses
are also randomly distributed.

<h2>II. MODES OF DETECTOR OPERATION</h2>
We can now introduce a fundamental distinction between three general modes of operation
of radiation detectors. The three modes are called <i>pulse mode</i>, <i>current mode</i>, and <i>mean
square voltage mode</i> (abbreviated <i>MSV mode</i>, or sometimes called <i>Campbelling mode</i>).
Pulse mode is easily the most commonly applied of these, but current mode also finds many
applications. MSV mode is limited to some specialized applications that make use of its
unique characteristics. Although the three modes are operationally distinct, they are interrelated
through their common dependence on the sequence of current pulses that are the
output of our simplified detector model.

<p>In pulse mode operation, the measurement instrumentation is designed to record each
individual quantum of radiation that interacts in the detector. In most common applications,
the time integral of each burst of current, or the total charge \(Q\), is recorded since the
energy deposited in the detector is directly related to \(Q\). All detectors used to measure the
energy of individual radiation quanta must be operated in pulse mode. Such applications
are categorized as <i>radiation spectroscopy</i> and are the subject of much of the remainder of
this text.</p>

<p>In other circumstances, a simpler approach may suit the needs of the measurement: All
pulses above a low-level threshold are registered from the detector, regardless of the value
of \(Q\). This approach is often called <i>pulse counting</i>, and we will show various examples later
in this text. It can be useful in many applications in which only the intensity of the radiation
is of interest, rather than sensing any changes in or information about the incident
energy distribution of the radiation.</p>

<p>At very high event rates, pulse mode operation becomes impractical or even impossible.
The time between adjacent events may become too short to carry out an adequate
analysis, or the current pulses from successive events may overlap in time. In such cases,
one can revert to alternative measurement techniques that respond to the time average
taken over many individual events. This approach leads to the remaining two modes of
operation: current mode and MSV mode.</p>

<h3>A. Current Mode</h3>
In the sketch below, we show a current-measuring device (an ammeter or, more practically,
a picoammeter) connected across the output terminals of a radiation detector.

<p><img src="noname4.3.png" width="395" height="249" alt=""></p>

<p>If we assume that the measuring device has a fixed response time \(T\), then the recorded
signal from a sequence of events will be a time-dependent current given by
\[
I(t) = \frac{1}{T}\int_{t - T}^t i(t')dt' \tag{4.1}
\]

Because the response time \(T\) is typically long compared with the average time between
individual current pulses from the detector, the effect is to average out many of the fluctuations
in the intervals between individual radiation interactions and to record an average
current that depends on the product of the interaction rate and the charge per interaction.
In current mode, this time average of the individual current bursts serves as the basic signal
that is recorded.</p>

<p>At any instant of time, however, there is a statistical uncertainty in this signal due to the
random fluctuations in the arrival time of the event. In many ways, the integration time \(T\) is
analogous to the measurement time discussed in the statistical analysis of the previous chapter.
Thus, the choice of large \(T\) will minimize statistical fluctuations in the signal but will also
slow the response to rapid changes in the rate or nature of the radiation interactions.</p>

<p>The <i>average</i> current is given by the product of the average event rate and the charge
produced per event.
\[
I_0 = rQ = r\frac{E}{W}q \tag{4.2}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
r &=& {\rm event \, rate}\\
Q &=& Eq/W = {\rm charge \, produced \, for \, each \, event}\\
E &=& {\rm average \, energy \, deposited \, per \, event}\\
W &=& {\rm average \, energy \, required \, to \, produce \, a \, unit \, charge \, pair (e.g., electron\text{-}ion \, pair)}\\
q &=& 1.6 \times 10^{-19}C
\end{eqnarray}
</p>

<p>For steady-state irradiation of the detector, this average current can also be rewritten
as the sum of a constant current \(I\). plus a time-dependent fluctuating component \(\sigma_i(t)\), as
sketched below.</p>

<p><img src="noname4.4.png" width="321" height="169" alt=""></p>

Here \(\sigma_i(t)\) is a random time-dependent variable that occurs as a consequence of the random
nature of the radiation events interacting within the detector.

<p>A statistical measure of this random component is the variance or mean square value,
defined as the time average of the square of the difference between the fluctuating current
\(I(t)\) and the average current \(I_0\). This mean square value is given by
\[
\overline{\sigma_I^2(t)} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{t - T}^t[I(t') - I_0]^2 dt' = \frac{1}{T}\sigma_i^2(t')dt' \tag{4.3}
\]

and the standard deviation follows as
\[
\overline{\sigma_I(t)} = \sqrt{\overline{\sigma_I^2(t)}} \tag{4.4}
\]

<p>Recall from Poisson statistics that the standard deviation in the number of recorded
events \(n\) over a given observation period is expected to be
\[
\sigma_n = \sqrt{n} \tag{4.5}
\]

Therefore, the standard deviation in the number of events occurring at a rate \(r\) in an effective
measurement time \(T\) is simply
\[
\sigma_n = \sqrt{rT} \tag{4.6}
\]

If each pulse contributes the same charge, the <i>fractional</i> standard deviation in the measured
signal due to random fluctuations in pulse arrival time is given by
\[
\frac{\overline{\sigma_i(t)}}{I_0} = \frac{\sigma_n}{n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{rT}} \tag{4.7}
\]
</p>

<p>It should be noted that, in the derivation of Eq. (4.7), the charge produced in each
event (\(Q\)) is assumed to be constant. Therefore, the result accounts for only the random
fluctuations in pulse arrival time, but not for fluctuations in pulse amplitude. In some applications,
however, this second source of variance in the signal is small in comparison with
the first, and the general character of the results given remains applicable.</p>

<h3>B. Mean Square Voltage Mode</h3>
An extension of this discussion of the statistical properties of the signal in current mode
leads us to the next general mode of operation: the mean square voltage (MSV) mode.
Suppose that we send the current signal through a circuit element that blocks the average
current \(I\). and only passes the fluctuating component \(\sigma_i(t)\). By providing additional signal-processing
elements, we now compute the time average of the squared amplitude of \|\sigma_i(t)\).
(The details of these circuits are not important here; for further discussion see Ref. 2.) The
processing steps are illustrated below:

<p><img src="noname4.5.png" width="490" height="62" alt=""></p>

The result corresponds to the quantity \(\overline{\sigma_I^2(t)}\) defined previously in Eq. (4.3). Combining
Eqs. (4.2) and (4.7), we predict the magnitude of the signal derived in this way to be
\[
\overline{\sigma_I^2(t)} = \frac{rQ^2}{T} \tag{4.8}
\]

We see that this mean square signal is directly proportional to the event rate \(r\) and, more
significantly, proportional to the square of the charge \(Q\) produced in each event. An analysis
of this mode of operation was first given by Campbell and the term <i>Campbelling mode</i>
is therefore substituted for MSV mode in some usage.

<p>The MSV mode of operation is most useful when making measurements in mixed
radiation environments when the charge produced by one type of radiation is much different
than that from the second type. If simple current mode operation is chosen, the
measured current will linearly reflect the charges contributed by each type. In MSV mode,
however, the derived signal is proportional to the square of the charge per event. This operational
mode will therefore further weight the detector response in favor of the type of
radiation giving the larger average charge per event. As one example of the useful application
of the MSV mode, in Chapter 14 we describe its use with neutron detectors in reactor
instrumentation to enhance the neutron signal compared with the response due to
smaller-amplitude gamma-ray events.</p>

<h3>C. Pulse Mode</h3>
In reviewing various applications of radiation detectors, we find that current mode operation
is used with many detectors when event rates are very high. Detectors that are applied
to radiation dosimetry are also normally operated in current mode for reasons that will be
discussed in Chapter 5. MSV mode is useful in enhancing the relative response to large-amplitude
events and finds widespread application in reactor instrumentation. Most applications,
however, are better served by preserving information on the amplitude and timing
of individual events that only pulse mode can provide. Consequently, the remainder of this
chapter deals with various aspects of pulse mode operation.

<P>The nature of the signal pulse produced from a single event depends on the input characteristics
of the circuit to which the detector is connected (usually a preamplifier). The
equivalent circuit can often be represented as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="noname4.6.png" width="389" height="71" alt=""></p>

Here \(R\) represents the input resistance of the circuit, and \(C\) represents the equivalent
capacitance of both the detector itself and the measuring circuit. If, for example, a preamplifier
is attached to the detector, then \(R\) is its input resistance and \(C\) is the summed capacitance
of the detector, the cable used to connect the detector to the preamplifier, and the
input capacitance of the preamplifier itself. In most cases, the time-dependent voltage \(V(t)\)
across the load resistance is the fundamental signal voltage on which pulse mode operation
is based. Two separate extremes of operation can be identified that depend on the relative
value of the time constant of the measuring circuit. From simple circuit analysis, this time
constant is given by the product of \(R\) and \(C\), or \(\tau) = RC\).

<p><img src="fig4.1.png" width="489" height="447" alt=""></p>

<h4>CASE 1. SMALL RC(\(\tau \ll t_c\))</h4>
In this extreme the time constant of the external circuit is kept small compared with the
charge collection time, so that the current flowing through the load resistance \(R\) is essentially
equal to the instantaneous value of the current flowing in the detector. The signal
voltage \(V(t)\) produced under these conditions has a shape nearly identical to the time
dependence of the current produced within the detector as illustrated in Fig. 4.1b.
Radiation detectors are sometimes operated under these conditions when high event rates
or timing information is more important than accurate energy information.

<h4>CASE 2. LARGE RC (\(\tau \gg t_c\))</h4>
It is generally more common to operate detectors in the opposite extreme in which the
time constant of the external circuit is much larger than the detector charge collection time.
In this case, very little current will flow in the load resistance during the charge collection
time and the detector current is momentarily integrated on the capacitance. If we assume
that the time between pulses is sufficiently large, the capacitance will then discharge
through the resistance, returning the voltage across the load resistance to zero. The corresponding
signal voltage \(V(t)\) is illustrated in Fig. 4.1c.

<p>Because the latter case is by far the most common means of pulse-type operation of
detectors, it is important to draw some general conclusions. First, the time required for the
signal pulse to reach its maximum value is determined by the charge collection time within
the detector itself. No properties of the external or load circuit influence the rise time of the
pulses. On the other hand, the decay time of the pulses, or the time required to restore the
signal voltage to zero, is determined only by the time constant of the load circuit. The conclusion
that the leading edge is detector dependent and the trailing edge circuit dependent is
a generality that will hold for a wide variety of radiation detectors operated under the conditions
in which \(RC \gg t_c\). Second, the amplitude of a signal pulse shown as \(V_{max}\) in Fig. 4.1c
is determined simply by the ratio of the total charge \(Q\) created within the detector during one
radiation interaction divided by the capacitance \(C\) of the equivalent load circuit. Because this
capacitance is normally fixed, the amplitude of the signal pulse is directly proportional to the
corresponding charge generated within the detector and is given by the simple expression</p>
\[
V_{max} = Q/C \tag{4.9}
\]

<p>Thus, the output of a detector operated in pulse mode normally consists of a sequence
of individual signal pulses, each representing the results of the interaction of a single quantum
of radiation within the detector. A measurement of the rate at which such pulses occur
will give the corresponding rate of radiation interactions within the detector. Furthermore,
the amplitude of each individual pulse reflects the amount of charge generated due to each
individual interaction. We shall see that a very common analytical method is to record the
distribution of these amplitudes from which some information can often be inferred about
the incident radiation. An example is that set of conditions in which the charge \(Q\) is directly
proportional to the energy of the incident quantum of radiation. Then, a recorded distribution
of pulse amplitudes will reflect the corresponding distribution in energy of the
incident radiation.</p>

<p>As shown by Eq.(4.9), the proportionality between \(V_{max}\) and \(Q\) holds only if the capacitance
\(C\) remains constant. In most detectors, the inherent capacitance is set by its size and
shape, and the assumption of constancy is fully warranted. In other types (notably the semiconductor
diode detector), the capacitance may change with variations in normal operating
parameters. In such cases, voltage pulses of different amplitude may result from events
with the same \(Q\). In order to preserve the basic information carried by the magnitude of \(Q\),
a type of preamplifier circuit known as a charge-sensitive configuration has come into widespread
use. As described in Chapter 17, this type of circuit uses feedback to largely eliminate
the dependence of the output amplitude on the value of \(C\) and restores proportionality
to the charge \(Q\) even in cases in which \(C\) may change.</p>

<p>Pulse mode operation is the more common choice for most radiation detector applications
because of several inherent advantages over current mode. First, the sensitivity that
is achievable is often many factors greater than when using current or MSV mode because
each individual quantum of radiation can be detected as a distinct pulse. Lower limits of
detectability are then normally set by background radiation levels. In current mode, the
minimum detectable current may represent an average interaction rate in the detector that
is many times greater. The second and more important advantage is that each pulse amplitude
carries some information that is often a useful or even necessary part of a particular
application. In both current and MSV mode operations, this information on individual
pulse amplitudes is lost and all interactions, regardless of amplitude, contribute to the
average measured current. Because of these inherent advantages of pulse mode, the emphasis
in nuclear instrumentation is largely in pulse circuits and pulse-processing techniques.</p>

<h2>III. PULSE HEIGHT SPECTRA</h2>
When operating a radiation detector in pulse mode, each individual pulse amplitude carries
important information regarding the charge generated by that particular radiation
interaction in the detector. If we examine a large number of such pulses, their amplitudes
will not all be the same. Variations may be due either to differences in the radiation energy
or to fluctuations in the inherent response of the detector to monoenergetic radiation.
The pulse amplitude distribution is a fundamental property of the detector output that is
routinely used to deduce information about the incident radiation or the operation of the
detector itself.

<p>The most common way of displaying pulse amplitude information is through the differential
pulse height distribution. Figure 4.2a gives a hypothetical distribution for purposes
of example. The abscissa is a linear pulse amplitude scale that runs from zero to a value
larger than the amplitude of any pulse observed from the source. The ordinate is the differential
number \(dN\) of pulses observed with an amplitude within the differential amplitude
increment \(dH\), divided by that increment, or \(dN/dH\). The horizontal scale then has
units of pulse amplitude (\(volts\)), whereas the vertical scale has units of inverse amplitude
(\(volts^{-1}\)). The number of pulses whose amplitude lies between two specific values, \(H_1\) and
\(H_2\), can be obtained by integrating the area under the distribution between those two limits,
as shown by the cross-hatched area in Fig. 4.2a:</p>

<img src="fig4.2.png" width="476" height="629" alt="">

\[
{\rm number \, of \, pulses \, with \, amplitude \, between \, } H_1 {\rm \, and \, } H_2 = \int_0^\infty \frac{dN}{dH}dH \tag{4.10}
\]

The total number of pulses \(N_0\) represented by the distribution can be obtained by integrating
the area under the entire spectrum:
\[
N_0 = \int_0^\infty\frac{dN}{dH}dH \tag{4.11}
\]

<p>Most users of radiation instrumentation are accustomed to looking at the shape of the
differential pulse height distribution to display significant features about the source of the
pulses. The maximum pulse height observed (\(H_5\)) is simply the point along the abscissa at
which the distribution goes to zero. Peaks in the distribution, such as at \(H_4\), indicate pulse
amplitudes about which a large number of pulses may be found. On the other hand, valleys
or low points in the spectrum, such as at pulse height \(H_3\), indicate values of the pulse amplitude
around which relatively few pulses occur. The physical interpretation of differential
pulse height spectra always involves areas under the spectrum between two given limits of
pulse height. The value of the ordinate itself (\(dN/dH\)) has no physical significance until
multiplied by an increment of the abscissa \(H\).</p>

<p>A less common way of displaying the same information about the distribution of pulse
amplitudes is through the integral pulse height distribution. Figure 4.2b shows the integral distribution
for the same pulse source displayed as a differential spectrum in Fig. 4.2a. The abscissa
in the integral case is the same pulse height scale shown for the differential
distribution.The ordinate now represents the number of pulses whose amplitude exceeds that
of a given value of the abscissa \(H\). The ordinate \(N\) must always be a monotonically decreasing
function of \(H\) because fewer and fewer pulses will lie above an amplitude \(H\) that is allowed to
increase from zero. Because all pulses have some finite amplitude, the value of the integral
spectrum at \(H = 0\) must be the total number of pulses observed (\(N_0\)). The value of the integral
distribution must decrease to zero at the maximum observed pulse height (\(H_5\)).</p>

<p>The differential and integral distributions convey exactly the same information and
one can be derived from the other. The amplitude of the differential distribution at any
pulse height His given by the absolute value of the slope of the integral distribution at the
same value. Where peaks appear in the differential distribution, such as \(H_4\), local maxima
will occur in the magnitude of the slope of the integral distribution. On the other hand,
where minima appear in the differential spectrum, such as H3, regions of minimum magnitude
of the slope are observed in the integral distribution. Because it is easier to display
subtle differences by using the differential distribution, it has become the predominant
means of displaying pulse height distribution information.</p>

<h2>IV. COUNTING CURVES AND PLATEAUS</h2>
When radiation detectors are operated in pulse counting mode, a common situation often
arises in which the pulses from the detector are fed to a counting device with a fixed discrimination
level. Signal pulses must exceed a given level \(H_d\) in order to be registered by
the counting circuit. Sometimes it is possible to vary the level \(H_d\) during the course of the
measurement to provide information about the amplitude distribution of the pulses.
Assuming that \(H_d\) can be varied between 0 and \(H_5\) in Fig. 4.2, a series of measurements can
be carried out in which the number of pulses \(N\) per unit time is measured as \(H_d\) is changed
through a sequence of values between 0 and \(H_5\). This series of measurements is just an
experimental determination of the integral pulse height distribution, and the measured
counts should lie directly on the curve shown in Fig. 4.2b.

<p>In setting up a pulse counting measurement, it is often desirable to establish an operating
point that will provide maximum stability over long periods of time. For example,
small drifts in the value of \(H_d\) could be expected in any real application, and one would
like to establish conditions under which these drifts would have minimal influence on the
measured counts. One such stable operating point can be achieved at a discrimination
point set at the level \(H_3\) in Fig. 4.2. Because the slope of the integral distribution is a minimum
at that point, small changes in the discrimination level will have minimum impact on
the total number of pulses recorded. In general, regions of minimum slope on the integral
distribution are called <i>counting plateaus</i> and represent areas of operation in which minimum
sensitivity to drifts in discrimination level are achieved. It should be noted that
plateaus in the integral spectrum correspond to valleys in the differential distribution.</p>

<p>Plateaus in counting data can also be observed with a different procedure. For a particular
radiation detector it is often possible to vary the gain or amplification provided for
the charge produced in radiation interactions. This variation could be accomplished by
varying the amplification factor of a linear amplifier between the detector and counting
circuit, or in many cases more directly by changing the applied voltage to the detector itself.</p>

<p><img src="fig4.3.png" width="561" height="567" alt=""></p>

Figure 4.3 shows the differential pulse height distribution corresponding to three different
values of voltage gain applied to the same source of pulses. Here the value of gain can be
defined as the ratio of the voltage amplitude for a given event in the detector to the same
amplitude before some parameter (such as amplification or detector voltage) was changed.
The highest voltage gain will result in the largest maximum pulse height, but in all cases the
area under the differential distribution will be a constant. In the example shown in Fig. 4.3,
no counts will be recorded for a gain \(G = 1\) because under those conditions all pulses will
be smaller than \(H_d\). Pulses will begin to be recorded somewhere between a gain \(G = 1\) and
\(G = 2\). An experiment can be carried out in which the number of pulses recorded is measured
as a function of the gain applied, sometimes called the <i>counting curve</i>. Such a plot is
also shown in Fig. 4.3 and in many ways resembles an integral pulse height distribution. We
now have a mirror image of the integral distribution, however, because small values of the
gain will record no pulses, whereas large values will result in counting nearly all the pulses.
Again, plateaus can be anticipated in this counting curve for values of the gain in which the
effective discrimination pulse height \(H_d\) passes through minimal in the differential pulse
height distribution. In the example shown in Fig. 4.3, the minimum slope in the counting
curve should correspond to a gain of about 3, in which case the discrimination point is near
the minimum of the valley in the differential pulse height distribution.

<p>In some types of radiation detectors, such as Geiger-Mueller tubes or scintillation
counters, the gain can conveniently be varied by changing the applied voltage to the detector.
Although the gain may not change linearly with voltage, the qualitative features of the
counting curve can be traced by a simple measurement of the detector counting rate as a
function of voltage. In order to select an operating point of maximum stability, plateaus are
again sought in the counting curve that results, and the voltage is often selected to lie at a
point of minimum slope on this counting curve. We shall discuss these plateau measurements
more specifically in Chapters 6 and 7 in connection with proportional counters and
Geiger-Mueller detectors.</p>
