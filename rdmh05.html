<h1>Ionization Chambers</h1>
Several of the oldest and most widely used types of radiation detectors are based on the
effects produced when a charged particle passes through a gas.The primary modes of interaction
involve ionization and excitation of gas molecules along the particle track. Although
the excited molecules can at times be used to derive an appropriate signal (as in the gas
scintillators discussed in Chapter 8), the majority of gas-filled detectors are based on sensing
the direct ionization created by the passage of the radiation. The detectors that are the
topic of the following three chapters (ion chambers, proportional counters, Geiger tubes)
all derive, in somewhat different ways, an electronic output signal that originates with the
ion pairs formed within the gas filling the detector.

<p>Ion chambers in principle are the simplest of all gas-filled detectors. Their normal operation
is based on collection of all the charges created by direct ionization within the gas
through the application of an electric field. As with other detectors, ion chambers can be
operated in current or pulse mode. In most common applications, ion chambers are used in
current mode as dc devices, although some examples of pulse mode applications will be
given at the end of this chapter. In contrast, proportional counters or Geiger tubes are
almost always used in pulse mode.</p>

<p>The term <i>ionization chamber</i> has conventionally come to be used exclusively for the
type of detector in which ion pairs are collected from gases. The corresponding process in
solids is the collection of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor detectors described in
Chapters 11-13. Direct ionization is only rarely exploited in liquids, although some developments
of this type are described in Chapter 19.</p>

<p>Many details that are omitted in the following discussions can be found in the classic
books on ionization chambers by Rossi and Staub and by Wilkinson More specific
descriptions of chamber design and construction are included in other books, of which
Refs. 3-5 are representative examples.</p>

<h2>I. THE IONIZATION PROCESS IN GASES</h2>
As a fast charged particle passes through a gas, the types of interaction detailed in Chapter 2
create both excited molecules and ionized molecules along its path. After a neutral molecule
is ionized, the resulting positive ion and free electron are called an <i>ion pair</i>, and it serves
as the basic constituent of the electrical signal developed by the ion chamber. Ions can be
formed either by direct interaction with the incident particle, or through a secondary
process in which some of the particle energy is first transferred to an energetic electron or
"delta ray" (see Chapter 2). Regardless of the detailed mechanisms involved, the practical
quantity of interest is the total number of ion pairs created along the track of the radiation.

<h3>A. Number of Ion Pairs Formed</h3>
At a minimum, the particle must transfer an amount of energy equal to the ionization energy
of the gas molecule to permit the ionization process to occur. In most gases of interest for
radiation detectors, the ionization energy for the least tightly bound electron shells is
between 10 and 25 \(eV\). However, there are other mechanisms by which the incident particle
may lose energy within the gas that do not create ions. Examples are excitation processes
in which an electron may be elevated to a higher bound state in the molecule without
being completely removed. Therefore, the average energy lost by the incident particle per
ion pair formed (defined as the <i>W-value</i>) is always substantially greater than the ionization
energy. The \(W\)-value is in principle a function of the species of gas involved, the type of
radiation, and its energy. Empirical observations, however, show that it is not a strong function
of any of these variables and is a remarkably constant parameter for many gases and
different types of radiation. Some specific data are shown in Table 5.1, and a typical value
is 25-35 \(eV/ion\,pair\). Therefore, an incident \(1 MeV\) particle, if it is fully stopped within the
gas, will create about 30,000 ion pairs. Assuming that \(W\) is constant for a given type of radiation,
the deposited energy will be proportional to the number of ion pairs formed and can
be determined if a corresponding measurement of the number of ion pairs is carried out.

<h3>B. The Fano Factor</h3>
In addition to the mean number of ion pairs formed by each incident particle, the fluctuation
in their number for incident particles of identical energy is also of interest. These fluctuations
will set a fundamental limit on the energy resolution that can be achieved in any
detector based on collection of the ions. In the simplest model, the formation of each ion
pair will be considered a Poisson process. The total number of ion pairs formed should
therefore be subject to fluctuations characterized by a standard deviation equal to the
square root of the average number formed. As discussed in Chapter 4, many radiation
detectors show an inherent fluctuation that is less than predicted by this simplified model.
The <i>Fano factor</i> is introduced as an empirical constant by which the predicted variance
must be multiplied to give the experimentally observed variance [see Eq. (4.14)].

<p>The Fano factor reflects to some degree the fraction of all the incident particle energy
that is converted into information carriers within the detector. If the entire energy of the
incident radiation were always converted into ion pairs, the number of pairs produced
would always be precisely the same and there would be no statistical fluctuation. Under
these conditions the Fano factor would be zero. If only a very small fraction of the incident
radiation is converted, however, then the ion pairs would be formed far apart and with a
relatively low probability, and there would be a good reason to expect that the distribution
in their number should follow a Poisson distribution. In gases, the Fano factor is empirically
observed to be less than 1 so that the fluctuations are smaller than would be predicted
based on Poisson statistics alone.</p>

<p>The Fano factor has significance only when the detector is operated in pulse mode. We
therefore postpone further discussions of its magnitude in gases to the following chapter
on proportional counters, where pulse mode operation and good energy resolution are
more important considerations.</p>

<h3>C. Diffusion, Charge Transfer, and Recombination</h3>
The neutral atoms or molecules of the gas are in constant thermal motion, characterized by
a mean free path for typical gases under standard conditions of about \(10^{-6} - 10^{-8} m\). Positive
ions or free electrons created within the gas also take part in the random thermal motion
and therefore have some tendency to diffuse away from regions of high density. This diffusion
process is much more pronounced for free electrons than for ions since their average
thermal velocity is much greater. A point-like collection of free electrons will spread about
the original point into a Gaussian spatial distribution whose width will increase with time.
If we let \(\sigma\) be the standard deviation of this distribution as projected onto an arbitrary
orthogonal axis (\(x\), \(y\), or \(z\)), and \(t\) be the elapsed time, then it can be shown that
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{Dt} \tag{5.1}
\]

The value of the diffusion coefficient \(D\) in simple cases can be predicted from kinetic gas
theory, but in general, a more complex transport model is required to accurately model
experimental observation.

<p>Of the many types of collisions that will normally take place between free electrons,
ions, and neutral gas molecules, several that are important in understanding the behavior
of gas-filled detectors are shown schematically in Fig. 5.1. </p>

<i>Charge transfer collisions</i> can occur when a positive ion 
encounters another neutral gas molecule. In such a collision. an
electron is transferred from the neutral molecule to the ion, thereby reversing the roles of
each. This charge transfer is particularly significant in gas mixtures containing several different
molecular species. There will then be a tendency to transfer the net positive charge
to the gas with the lowest ionization energy because energy is liberated in collisions which
leave that species as the positive ion.

<p>The free electron member of the original ion pair also undergoes many collisions in its
normal diffusion. In some species of gas, there may be a tendency to form negative ions by
the attachment of the free electron to a neutral gas molecule. This negative ion then shares
many properties with the original positive ion formed in the ionization process, but with
opposite electric charge. Oxygen is an example of a gas that readily attaches electrons, so
that free electrons diffusing in air are rapidly converted to negative ions. In contrast, nitrogen,
hydrogen, hydrocarbon gases, and noble gases all are characterized by relatively low
electron attachment coefficients, and therefore the electron continues to migrate in these
gases as a free electron under normal conditions.</p>

<p>Collisions between positive ions and free electrons may result in recombination in
which the electron is captured by the positive ion and returns it to a state of charge neutrality.
Alternatively, the positive ion may undergo a collision with a negative ion in which
the extra electron is transferred to the positive ion and both ions are neutralized. In either
case, the charge represented by the original pair is lost and cannot contribute further to the
signal in detectors based on collection of the ionization charge.</p>

<p>Because the collision frequency is proportional to the product of the concentrations of
the two species involved, the recombination rate can be written
\[
\frac{dn^+}{dt} = \frac{dn^-}{dt} = -\alpha n^+ n^- \tag{5.2}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
n^+ &=& {\rm number \, density \, of \, positive \, species} \\
n^- &=& {\rm number \, density \, of \, negative \, species} \\
\alpha &=& {\rm recombination \, coefficient}
\end{eqnarray}

The recombination coefficient is normally orders of magnitude larger between positive
ions and negative ions compared with that between positive ions and free electrons. In
gases that readily form negative ions through electron attachment, virtually all the recombination
takes place between positive and negative ions.</p>

<p>There are two general types of recombination loss: <i>columnar</i> recombination and <i>volume</i>
recombination. The first type (sometimes also called <i>initial</i> recombination) arises from
the fact that ion pairs are first formed in a column along the track of the ionizing particle.
The local density of ion pairs is therefore high along the track until the ion pairs are caused
to drift or diffuse away from their point of formation. Columnar recombination is most
severe for densely ionizing particles such as alpha particles or fission fragments compared
with fast electrons that deposit their energy over a much longer track. This loss mechanism
is dependent only on the local conditions along individual tracks and does not depend on
the rate at which such tracks are formed within the detector volume. In contrast, volume
recombination is due to encounters between ions and/or electrons after they have left the
immediate location of the track. Since many tracks are typically formed over the time it
takes for ions to drift all the way to the collecting electrodes, it is possible for ions and/or
electrons from independent tracks to collide and recombine. Volume recombination therefore
increases in importance with irradiation rate. Thus charge separation and collection
should be as rapid as possible in order to minimize recombination, and high electric fields
are indicated for this purpose.</p>
