<h1>Ionization Chambers</h1>
Several of the oldest and most widely used types of radiation detectors are based on the
effects produced when a charged particle passes through a gas.The primary modes of interaction
involve ionization and excitation of gas molecules along the particle track. Although
the excited molecules can at times be used to derive an appropriate signal (as in the gas
scintillators discussed in Chapter 8), the majority of gas-filled detectors are based on sensing
the direct ionization created by the passage of the radiation. The detectors that are the
topic of the following three chapters (ion chambers, proportional counters, Geiger tubes)
all derive, in somewhat different ways, an electronic output signal that originates with the
ion pairs formed within the gas filling the detector.

<p>Ion chambers in principle are the simplest of all gas-filled detectors. Their normal operation
is based on collection of all the charges created by direct ionization within the gas
through the application of an electric field. As with other detectors, ion chambers can be
operated in current or pulse mode. In most common applications, ion chambers are used in
current mode as dc devices, although some examples of pulse mode applications will be
given at the end of this chapter. In contrast, proportional counters or Geiger tubes are
almost always used in pulse mode.</p>

<p>The term <i>ionization chamber</i> has conventionally come to be used exclusively for the
type of detector in which ion pairs are collected from gases. The corresponding process in
solids is the collection of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor detectors described in
Chapters 11-13. Direct ionization is only rarely exploited in liquids, although some developments
of this type are described in Chapter 19.</p>

<p>Many details that are omitted in the following discussions can be found in the classic
books on ionization chambers by Rossi and Staub and by Wilkinson More specific
descriptions of chamber design and construction are included in other books, of which
Refs. 3-5 are representative examples.</p>
