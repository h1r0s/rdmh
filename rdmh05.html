<h1>Ionization Chambers</h1>
Several of the oldest and most widely used types of radiation detectors are based on the
effects produced when a charged particle passes through a gas.The primary modes of interaction
involve ionization and excitation of gas molecules along the particle track. Although
the excited molecules can at times be used to derive an appropriate signal (as in the gas
scintillators discussed in Chapter 8), the majority of gas-filled detectors are based on sensing
the direct ionization created by the passage of the radiation. The detectors that are the
topic of the following three chapters (ion chambers, proportional counters, Geiger tubes)
all derive, in somewhat different ways, an electronic output signal that originates with the
ion pairs formed within the gas filling the detector.

<p>Ion chambers in principle are the simplest of all gas-filled detectors. Their normal operation
is based on collection of all the charges created by direct ionization within the gas
through the application of an electric field. As with other detectors, ion chambers can be
operated in current or pulse mode. In most common applications, ion chambers are used in
current mode as dc devices, although some examples of pulse mode applications will be
given at the end of this chapter. In contrast, proportional counters or Geiger tubes are
almost always used in pulse mode.</p>

<p>The term <i>ionization chamber</i> has conventionally come to be used exclusively for the
type of detector in which ion pairs are collected from gases. The corresponding process in
solids is the collection of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor detectors described in
Chapters 11-13. Direct ionization is only rarely exploited in liquids, although some developments
of this type are described in Chapter 19.</p>

<p>Many details that are omitted in the following discussions can be found in the classic
books on ionization chambers by Rossi and Staub and by Wilkinson More specific
descriptions of chamber design and construction are included in other books, of which
Refs. 3-5 are representative examples.</p>

<h2>I. THE IONIZATION PROCESS IN GASES</h2>
As a fast charged particle passes through a gas, the types of interaction detailed in Chapter 2
create both excited molecules and ionized molecules along its path. After a neutral molecule
is ionized, the resulting positive ion and free electron are called an <i>ion pair</i>, and it serves
as the basic constituent of the electrical signal developed by the ion chamber. Ions can be
formed either by direct interaction with the incident particle, or through a secondary
process in which some of the particle energy is first transferred to an energetic electron or
"delta ray" (see Chapter 2). Regardless of the detailed mechanisms involved, the practical
quantity of interest is the total number of ion pairs created along the track of the radiation.

<h3>A. Number of Ion Pairs Formed</h3>
At a minimum, the particle must transfer an amount of energy equal to the ionization energy
of the gas molecule to permit the ionization process to occur. In most gases of interest for
radiation detectors, the ionization energy for the least tightly bound electron shells is
between 10 and 25 \(eV\). However, there are other mechanisms by which the incident particle
may lose energy within the gas that do not create ions. Examples are excitation processes
in which an electron may be elevated to a higher bound state in the molecule without
being completely removed. Therefore, the average energy lost by the incident particle per
ion pair formed (defined as the <i>W-value</i>) is always substantially greater than the ionization
energy. The \(W\)-value is in principle a function of the species of gas involved, the type of
radiation, and its energy. Empirical observations, however, show that it is not a strong function
of any of these variables and is a remarkably constant parameter for many gases and
different types of radiation. Some specific data are shown in Table 5.1, and a typical value
is 25-35 \(eV/ion\,pair\). Therefore, an incident \(1 MeV\) particle, if it is fully stopped within the
gas, will create about 30,000 ion pairs. Assuming that \(W\) is constant for a given type of radiation,
the deposited energy will be proportional to the number of ion pairs formed and can
be determined if a corresponding measurement of the number of ion pairs is carried out.

<p><img src="tab5.1.png" width="531" height="341" alt=""></p>

<h3>B. The Fano Factor</h3>
In addition to the mean number of ion pairs formed by each incident particle, the fluctuation
in their number for incident particles of identical energy is also of interest. These fluctuations
will set a fundamental limit on the energy resolution that can be achieved in any
detector based on collection of the ions. In the simplest model, the formation of each ion
pair will be considered a Poisson process. The total number of ion pairs formed should
therefore be subject to fluctuations characterized by a standard deviation equal to the
square root of the average number formed. As discussed in Chapter 4, many radiation
detectors show an inherent fluctuation that is less than predicted by this simplified model.
The <i>Fano factor</i> is introduced as an empirical constant by which the predicted variance
must be multiplied to give the experimentally observed variance [see Eq. (4.14)].

<p>The Fano factor reflects to some degree the fraction of all the incident particle energy
that is converted into information carriers within the detector. If the entire energy of the
incident radiation were always converted into ion pairs, the number of pairs produced
would always be precisely the same and there would be no statistical fluctuation. Under
these conditions the Fano factor would be zero. If only a very small fraction of the incident
radiation is converted, however, then the ion pairs would be formed far apart and with a
relatively low probability, and there would be a good reason to expect that the distribution
in their number should follow a Poisson distribution. In gases, the Fano factor is empirically
observed to be less than 1 so that the fluctuations are smaller than would be predicted
based on Poisson statistics alone.</p>

<p>The Fano factor has significance only when the detector is operated in pulse mode. We
therefore postpone further discussions of its magnitude in gases to the following chapter
on proportional counters, where pulse mode operation and good energy resolution are
more important considerations.</p>

<h3>C. Diffusion, Charge Transfer, and Recombination</h3>
The neutral atoms or molecules of the gas are in constant thermal motion, characterized by
a mean free path for typical gases under standard conditions of about \(10^{-6} - 10^{-8} m\). Positive
ions or free electrons created within the gas also take part in the random thermal motion
and therefore have some tendency to diffuse away from regions of high density. This diffusion
process is much more pronounced for free electrons than for ions since their average
thermal velocity is much greater. A point-like collection of free electrons will spread about
the original point into a Gaussian spatial distribution whose width will increase with time.
If we let \(\sigma\) be the standard deviation of this distribution as projected onto an arbitrary
orthogonal axis (\(x\), \(y\), or \(z\)), and \(t\) be the elapsed time, then it can be shown that
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{Dt} \tag{5.1}
\]

The value of the diffusion coefficient \(D\) in simple cases can be predicted from kinetic gas
theory, but in general, a more complex transport model is required to accurately model
experimental observation.

<p>Of the many types of collisions that will normally take place between free electrons,
ions, and neutral gas molecules, several that are important in understanding the behavior
of gas-filled detectors are shown schematically in Fig. 5.1. </p>

<p><img src="fig5.1.png" width="538" height="385" alt=""></p>

<i>Charge transfer collisions</i> can occur when a positive ion 
encounters another neutral gas molecule. In such a collision. an
electron is transferred from the neutral molecule to the ion, thereby reversing the roles of
each. This charge transfer is particularly significant in gas mixtures containing several different
molecular species. There will then be a tendency to transfer the net positive charge
to the gas with the lowest ionization energy because energy is liberated in collisions which
leave that species as the positive ion.

<p>The free electron member of the original ion pair also undergoes many collisions in its
normal diffusion. In some species of gas, there may be a tendency to form negative ions by
the attachment of the free electron to a neutral gas molecule. This negative ion then shares
many properties with the original positive ion formed in the ionization process, but with
opposite electric charge. Oxygen is an example of a gas that readily attaches electrons, so
that free electrons diffusing in air are rapidly converted to negative ions. In contrast, nitrogen,
hydrogen, hydrocarbon gases, and noble gases all are characterized by relatively low
electron attachment coefficients, and therefore the electron continues to migrate in these
gases as a free electron under normal conditions.</p>

<p>Collisions between positive ions and free electrons may result in recombination in
which the electron is captured by the positive ion and returns it to a state of charge neutrality.
Alternatively, the positive ion may undergo a collision with a negative ion in which
the extra electron is transferred to the positive ion and both ions are neutralized. In either
case, the charge represented by the original pair is lost and cannot contribute further to the
signal in detectors based on collection of the ionization charge.</p>

<p>Because the collision frequency is proportional to the product of the concentrations of
the two species involved, the recombination rate can be written
\[
\frac{dn^+}{dt} = \frac{dn^-}{dt} = -\alpha n^+ n^- \tag{5.2}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
n^+ &=& {\rm number \, density \, of \, positive \, species} \\
n^- &=& {\rm number \, density \, of \, negative \, species} \\
\alpha &=& {\rm recombination \, coefficient}
\end{eqnarray}

The recombination coefficient is normally orders of magnitude larger between positive
ions and negative ions compared with that between positive ions and free electrons. In
gases that readily form negative ions through electron attachment, virtually all the recombination
takes place between positive and negative ions.</p>

<p>There are two general types of recombination loss: <i>columnar</i> recombination and <i>volume</i>
recombination. The first type (sometimes also called <i>initial</i> recombination) arises from
the fact that ion pairs are first formed in a column along the track of the ionizing particle.
The local density of ion pairs is therefore high along the track until the ion pairs are caused
to drift or diffuse away from their point of formation. Columnar recombination is most
severe for densely ionizing particles such as alpha particles or fission fragments compared
with fast electrons that deposit their energy over a much longer track. This loss mechanism
is dependent only on the local conditions along individual tracks and does not depend on
the rate at which such tracks are formed within the detector volume. In contrast, volume
recombination is due to encounters between ions and/or electrons after they have left the
immediate location of the track. Since many tracks are typically formed over the time it
takes for ions to drift all the way to the collecting electrodes, it is possible for ions and/or
electrons from independent tracks to collide and recombine. Volume recombination therefore
increases in importance with irradiation rate. Thus charge separation and collection
should be as rapid as possible in order to minimize recombination, and high electric fields
are indicated for this purpose.</p>

<h2>II. CHARGE MIGRATION AND COLLECTION</h2>
<h3>A. Charge Mobility</h3>
If an external electric field is applied to the region in which ions or electrons exist in the
gas, electrostatic forces will tend to move the charges away from their point of origin. The
net motion consists of a superposition of a random thermal velocity together with a net
drift velocity in a given direction. The drift velocity for positive ions is in the direction of
the conventional electric field, whereas free electrons and negative ions drift in the opposite
direction.

<p>For ions in a gas, the drift velocity can be fairly accurately predicted from the relation
\[
v = \frac{\mu\mathscr{E}}{p} \tag{5.3}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
v &=& {\rm drift \, velocity} \\
\mathscr{E} &=& {\rm electric \, field \, strength} \\
p &=& {\rm gas \, pressure}
\end{eqnarray}

The mobility \(\mu\) tends to remain fairly constant over wide ranges of electric field and gas
pressure and does not differ greatly for either positive or negative ions in the same gas.
Tabulated values for the mobility of ions in various gases can be found in Ref. 2. Typical
values are between 1 and \(1.5 \times 10^{-4} m^2 atom/V\cdot s\) for detector gases of medium atomic
number. Therefore, at 1 atm pressure, a typical electric field of \(10^4 V/m\) will result in a drift
velocity of the order of \(1 m/s\). Ion transit times over typical detector dimensions of a centimeter
will therefore be approximately \(10 ms\). By most standards, this is a very long time.</p>

<p>Free electrons behave quite differently. Their much lower mass allows a greater acceleration
between encounters with neutral gas molecules, and the value of the mobility in
Eq. (5.3) is typically 1000 times greater than that for ions. Typical collection times for electrons
are therefore of the order of microseconds, rather than milliseconds. In some gases,
for example, hydrocarbons and argon-hydrocarbon mixtures, there is a saturation effect in
the electric drift velocity (see Fig. 5.2).</p>

<p><img src="fig5.2.png" width="481" height="324" alt=""></p>

Its value approaches a maximum for high values of
the electric field and may even decrease slightly if the field is further increased. In many
other gases (see Fig. 6.15), the electron drift velocity continues to increase for the largest
\(\mathscr{E}/p\) values likely to be used in gas-filled counters.

<p>As the electrons are drifting through the gas under the influence of the electric field,
they will to first approximation follow the path of the electric field line that passes through
their point of origin (but in the reverse direction to the electric field vector). Random diffusion
of the electrons will still be taking place, however, causing each individual electron
to follow a slightly different path. For strong electric field values, the increased average
energy given the electron in the direction of the field results in different values of the diffusion
coefficient [\(D\) in Eq. (5.1)] for the directions that are parallel to or transverse to the
field. Over the few microseconds that are typically required for the electrons to reach a collecting
electrode, the diffusion in either direction might be of the order of a millimeter or
less. While in most standard detectors this charge spreading will have little practical effect,
it does play a potential role in limiting the position resolution attainable in "position-sensitive"
gas detectors that deduce the location of the ionizing event through the position
of arrival of the electrons at the anode, or through measuring the electron drift time.</p>

<h3>B. The Ionization Current</h3>
In the presence of an electric field, the drift of the positive and negative charges represented
by the ions and electrons constitutes an electric current. If a given volume of gas is
undergoing steady-state irradiation, the rate of formation of ion pairs is constant. For any
small test volume of the gas, this rate of formation will be exactly balanced by the rate at
which ion pairs are lost from the volume, either through recombination or by diffusion or
migration from the volume. Under the conditions that recombination is negligible and all
the charges are efficiently collected, the steady-state current produced is an accurate measure
of the rate at which ion pairs are formed within the volume. Measurement of this <i>ionization
current</i> is the basic principle of the dc ion chamber.

<p><img src="fig5.3.png" width="499" height="430" alt=""></p>

<p>Figure 5.3 illustrates the basic elements of a rudimentary ion chamber. A volume of gas
is enclosed within a region in which an electric field can be created by the application of an
external voltage. At equilibrium, the current flowing in the external circuit will be equal to
the ionization current collected at the electrodes, and a sensitive ammeter placed in the
external circuit can therefore measure the ionization current.</p>

<p>The current-voltage characteristics of such a chamber are also sketched in Fig. 5.3.
Neglecting some subtle effects related to differences in diffusion characteristics between
ions and electrons, no net current should flow in the absence of an applied voltage because
no electric field will then exist within the gas. Ions and electrons that are created ultimately
disappear either by recombination or by diffusion from the active volume. As the voltage is
increased, the resulting electric field begins to separate the ion pairs more rapidly, and
columnar recombination is diminished. The positive and negative charges are also swept
toward the respective electrodes with increasing drift velocity, reducing the equilibrium
concentration of ions within the gas and therefore further suppressing volume recombination
between the point of origin and the collecting electrodes. The measured current thus
increases with applied voltage as these effects reduce the amount of the original charge
that is lost. At a sufficiently high applied voltage, the electric field is large enough to effectively
suppress recombination to a negligible level, and all the original charges created
through the ionization process contribute to the ion current. Increasing the voltage further
cannot increase the current because all charges are already collected and their rate of formation
is constant. This is the region of <i>ion saturation</i> in which ion chambers are conventionally
operated. Under these conditions, the current measured in the external circuit is a
true indication of the rate of formation of all charges due to ionization within the active
volume of the chamber.</p>

<h3>C. Factors Affecting the Saturation Current</h3>
Several factors can detract from reaching saturation current in an ion chamber. The most
important of these is recombination, which is minimized by ensuring that a large value of
the electric field exists everywhere within the ion chamber volume. Columnar recombination
along the track of heavy charged particles (such as alpha particles or fission fragments)
is particularly significant, so that larger values of the applied voltage are required in these
cases to achieve saturation, compared with electron or gamma-ray irradiation. Also, the
effects of volume recombination are more important for higher intensity of the irradiation
(and thus higher ion currents), as illustrated in Fig. 5.4. 

<p><img src="fig5.4.png" width="491" height="285" alt=""></p>

Here the percentage by which the
measured current falls short of true saturation is seen to increase as a function of the measured
ion current. At the lower irradiation levels, the density of ions and electrons (or negative
ions) is correspondingly low, and from Eq. (5.2), the recombination rate is less
significant than at high rates. Thus higher voltages are required at high irradiation rates to
approach the true saturated ion current. This dependence is evident in the current-voltage
characteristics shown in Fig. 5.3 and also is apparent in the example of an ionization chamber
used for neutron monitoring shown in Fig. 14.14. In chambers operated with ambient air
as the fill gas, increases in the humidity level will also raise the volume recombination rate.

<p>If the production of ion pairs is uniform throughout the volume of the ion chamber,
the drift of positive charges toward the cathode and negative charges toward the anode will
create some imbalance in the steady-state concentrations of the two charge carriers. The
concentration of positive ions will be greatest near the cathode; the opposite is true for the
negative charges. Wherever a gradient exists for a species that is free to migrate, some net
diffusion must take place in the direction of decreasing concentration. The direction of diffusion
is therefore opposite that of the charge carrier flow caused by the electric field, and
the effect can be to reduce the measured ion current. From an analysis given by Rossi and
Staub the perturbation in the measured ion current is given by
\[
-\frac{\Delta I}{I} = \frac{\epsilon kT}{eV} \tag{5.4}
\]

where parallel planar electrodes have been assumed. In this expression,
\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon &=& {\rm ratio\,of\,the\,average\,energy\,of\,charge\,carrier\,with\,electric\,field\,present\,to\,that\,without\,the\,electric\,field}\\
k &=& {\rm Boltzmann \, constant} \\
T &=& {\rm absolute \, temperature} \\
e &=& {\rm electronic \, charge} \\
V &=& {\rm applied \, voltage \, between \, electrodes}
\end{eqnarray}

The size of this loss in the saturation current depends primarily on the applied voltage and
the size of the quantity \(\epsilon\) defined above. At room temperature, the factor \(kT/e\) is approximately
\(2.5 \times 10^{-2}V\). For ions, \(\epsilon\) is not much larger than unity, and Eq. (5.4) therefore predicts
that the loss due to diffusion is negligible even for low values of the applied voltage.
When the negative charge is carried by free electrons, however, \(\epsilon\) can be of the order of several
hundred and a significant loss in saturation current due to electron diffusion is possible.
Because \(\epsilon\) will tend toward a limiting saturated value as the voltage \(V\) is raised to high values,
the loss is minimized by operating the chamber at high values of the applied voltage</p>

<p>In many cases, losses due to diffusion and volume recombination can be reduced to
insignificant levels at reasonable values of the applied voltage. Columnar recombination is
more difficult to eliminate completely, and small losses may persist even at the highest
available voltages. It is then helpful to make a number of measurements of the ionization
current as a function of voltage in order to determine the true saturated current. It has
been shown that under these conditions a plot of \(1/I\) versus \(1/V\) can be used to extrapolate
the measurements to zero on the \(1/V\) axis (infinite electric field) to make an accurate
prediction of the saturated value of the current.</p>

<h2>III. DESIGN AND OPERATION OF DC ION CHAMBERS</h2>

<h3>A. General Considerations</h3>
When an ion chamber is used in direct current mode, it is possible to collect the negative
charges either as free electrons or as negative ions. Therefore, virtually any fill gas can be
used for the chamber, including those that have high electron attachment coefficients.
Although recombination is more significant when negative ions are formed, diffusion losses
are less important. Conditions of saturation can normally be achieved over dimensions of
a few centimeters using applied voltages that are no greater than tens or hundreds of volts.
Air is the most common fill gas and is one in which negative ions are readily formed. Air
is required in those chambers designed for the measurement of gamma-ray exposure (see
p. 140). Denser gases such as argon are sometimes chosen in other applications to increase
the ionization density within a given volume. The fill gas pressure is often 1 atmosphere,
although higher pressures are sometimes used to increase the sensitivity.

<p>The geometry chosen for an ion chamber can be varied greatly to suit the application,
provided the electric field throughout the active volume can be maintained high enough to
lead to saturation of the ion current. Parallel plate or planar geometry leads to a uniform
electric field between the plates. Also common is a cylindrical geometry in which the outer
shell of the cylinder is operated at ground potential and an axial conducting rod carries the
applied voltage. In this case, a field that varies inversely with radius is created. Analytical
methods that can be used to predict the current-voltage characteristics of chambers of various
geometries are described in Ref. 11.</p>

<h3>B. Insulators and Guard Rings</h3>
With any design, some sort of supporting insulator must be provided between the two electrodes.
Because typical ionization currents in most applications are extremely small (of the
order of \(10^{-12}A\) or less), the leakage current through these insulators must be kept very
small. In the simple scheme of Fig. 5.3, any leakage through the insulator will add to the
measured ionization current and cause an unwanted component of the signal. In order to
keep this component below 1% of an ionization current of \(10^{-12} A\) for an applied voltage
of \(100 V\), the resistance of the insulator would need to be greater than \(10^{16} ohms\). Although
it may be possible to find materials with bulk resistivity sufficiently high to meet this criterion,
leakage paths across the surface of the insulator due to absorbed moisture or other
contaminants almost always represent a lower resistance. A different design is therefore
often used in low-current applications of ion chambers in which a <i>guard ring</i> is employed
to reduce the effects of insulator leakage.

<p><img src="fig5.5.png" width="509" height="309" alt=""></p>

<p>A diagram illustrating the use of a guard ring is shown in Fig. 5.5. The insulator is now
segmented into two parts, one part separating the conducting guard ring from the negative
electrode and the other part separating it from the positive electrode. Most of the voltage
drop occurs across the outer segment in which the resulting leakage current does not pass
through the measuring instrument. The voltage drop across the inner segment is only the
voltage difference across the ammeter terminals and can be very small. Therefore, the component
of leakage current which is added to the signal is greatly reduced compared with
the case without the guard ring.</p>

<p>Insulators for applications that do not involve high radiation fields are normally manufactured
from one of the high-resistivity synthetic plastics. Care is taken to keep the
surface smooth and as free of defects as possible in order to minimize the amount of moisture
absorption. Radiation damage in these materials in high radiation applications (such
as in reactor instruments) can lead to rapid deterioration of the insulation properties. In
such cases, inorganic materials such as ceramics are preferred because of their higher
resistance to radiation damage.</p>

<h3>C. Measurement of the Ion Current</h3>
The magnitude of the ionization current under typical conditions is much too small to be
measured using standard galvanometer techniques. Instead, some active amplification of
the current must be carried out to allow its indirect measurement. An electrometer indirectly
measures the current by sensing the voltage drop across a series resistance placed in
the measuring circuit (see Fig. 5.6). 

<p><img src="fig5.6.png" width="557" height="212" alt=""></p>

The voltage developed across the resistor (typicallv
with a value of \(10^9-10^{12} ohms\)) can be amplified and serves as the basis for the measured
signal. One weakness of standard electrometer circuits is that they must be dc coupled
throughout. Any small drift or gradual change in component values therefore results in a
corresponding change in the measured output current. Thus, circuits of this type must frequently
be balanced by shorting the input and resetting the scale to zero.

<p>An alternative approach is to convert the signal from dc to ac at an early stage, which
then allows a more stable amplification of the ac signal in subsequent stages. This conversion
is accomplished in the <i>dynamic-capacitor</i> or <i>vibrating reed</i> electrometer by collecting
the ion current across an \(RC\) circuit with long time constant, as shown in Fig. 5.7. </p>

<p><img src="fig5.7.png" width="512" height="210" alt=""></p>


At equilibrium, a constant voltage is developed across this circuit, which is given by
\[
V = IR \tag{5.5}
\]

where \(I\) is the steady-state ionization current. A charge \(Q\) is stored on the capacitance,
which is given by
\[
Q = CV \tag{5.6}
\]

If the capacitance is now caused to change rapidly compared with the time constant of the
circuit, a corresponding change will be induced in the voltage across \(C\) given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta V &=& \frac{Q}{C^2}\Delta C \\
\Delta V &=& I\frac{R}{C}\Delta C \tag{5.7}
\end{eqnarray}

If the value of the capacitance is varied sinusoidally about an average value \(C\), the amplitude
of the ac voltage that is induced is therefore proportional to the ionization current.

<p>The average ionization current can also be measured over finite periods of time by
integration methods. If the value of \(R\) in Fig. 5.6 is made infinite, any ionization current
from the chamber is simply integrated across the capacitance \(C\). By noting the change in
the voltage across the capacitance over the measurement period, the total integrated ionization
current or ionization charge can be deduced. If the amount of natural leakage
across the capacitance can be kept small, this integration technique has the potential of
being able to measure much smaller ionization currents than through direct dc current
measurement.</p>

<p><img src="fig5.8.png" width="556" height="194" alt=""></p>

<p>To illustrate, suppose that the ion chamber of Fig. 5.8 is originally charged to a voltage
\(V_0\). If the leakage across the chamber insulators and external capacitor is negligible, this
voltage would be maintained at its original value indefinitely in the absence of ionizing
radiation. If radiation is present, the ions will act to partially discharge the capacitance and
reduce the voltage from its original value. If a charge \(\Delta Q\) (defined either as the positive
charge of the positive ions or the negative charge of the electrons) is created by the
radiation, then the total charge stored on the capacitance will be reduced by \(\Delta Q\). The voltage
will therefore drop from its original value of \(V_0\) by an amount \(\Delta V\) given by
\[
\Delta V = \frac{\Delta Q}{C} \tag{5.8}
\]

A measurement of \(\Delta V\) thus gives the total ionization charge or the integrated ionization
current over the period of the measurement.</p>

<h3>D. The Electret</h3>
The previous section described the measurement of ionization current integrated over a
period of time by noting the drop in voltage measured across the chamber capacitance
after an initial charging to a known voltage. A similar measurement can be carried out by
noting the drop in surface voltage on an element known as an <i>electret</i> that is placed
inside an ion chamber. An electret is a sample of dielectric material (commonly Teflon)
that carries a quasi-permanent electrical charge. A disk of the material of approximately
\(1cm\) diameter and \(1mm\) thickness is fabricated by heating in the presence of an electric
field and then cooling to "freeze" electric dipoles in place. A voltage of up to \(1000 V\) may
then appear between the opposite surfaces of the electret. With proper encapsulation, this
stored charge may be stable over periods of a year or more, even in the presence of high
humidity.

<p>An electret placed with one of its surfaces in contact with the conducting walls of an ion
chamber will create an electric field throughout the chamber volume because of the voltage
difference on its opposite surface. Any ion pairs created by radiation within the chamber
will be separated and collected by this field, serving to partially neutralize the charge carried
by the electret. Measurements of the electret voltage before and after the exposure can
then be calibrated in terms of the total ionization charge produced in the chamber.</p>

<h2>IV. RADIATION DOSE MEASUREMENT WITH ION CHAMBERS</h2>

<h3>A. Gamma-Ray Exposure</h3>
One of the most important applications of ion chambers is in the measurement of gamma-ray
exposure. An air-filled ion chamber is particularly well-suited for this application
because exposure is defined in terms of the amount of ionization charge created in air.
Under the proper conditions a determination of the ionization charge in an air-filled ionization
chamber can give an accurate measure of the exposure, and a measurement of the
ionization current will indicate the exposure rate.

<p>The task of measuring exposure is somewhat more complicated than it might first
appear, because it is defined in terms of the ionization created by all the secondary electrons
generated at the point at which the dose is to be measured. Strictly speaking, one
would need to follow each of these secondary electrons over its entire range and measure
all the ionization created along its track. Because the range in air of secondary electrons
created by typical gamma-ray energies can be several meters, it is impractical to design an
instrument that would carry out such a measurement directly. Instead, the principle of compensation
is used.</p>

<p>If the test volume of air is surrounded by an infinite sea of equivalent air that is also
subject to the same exposure over the course of the measurement, an exact compensation
will occur. That is, all the ionization charge created outside the test volume from secondary
electrons that were formed within the volume is exactly balanced by charge created within
the test volume from secondary electrons formed in the surrounding air. This situation is
illustrated in Fig. 5.9.</p>

<p><img src="fig5.9.png" width="515" height="632" alt=""></p>

<p>One popular design based on this compensation is diagrammed in Fig. 5.10 and is
called the <i>free-air ionization chamber</i>.</p>

<p><img src="fig5.10.png" width="518" height="347" alt=""></p>

Each end of the chamber is rendered insensitive by
grounding the guard electrodes shown in the diagram. The parallel plate geometry creates
electric field lines that are perpendicular to the plates in the space between them, but only
the volume defined by the central electrode collects ionization current that is registered by
the external circuit. The incident gamma-ray beam is collimated so that it is confined to a
region that is far from the chamber electrodes, and secondary electrons created in the sensitive
volume cannot reach either electrode. Compensation is therefore not required in the
vertical dimension but will take place in the horizontal dimension, provided the intensity
of the incident radiation beam is not appreciably reduced in its passage through the
chamber. Free-air ionization chambers are widely used for accurate exposure measurements
for gamma-ray energies below about \(100 keV\).

<p>At higher energies, the larger range of the secondary electrons creates some difficulties.
In order to prevent ionization loss from secondary electrons reaching the electrodes,
the dimensions of the chamber must become impractically large. Therefore, gamma-ray
exposure measurements at higher energies are conventionally carried out in cavity chambers
in which a small volume of air is surrounded by a solid material (chosen because its
properties are as similar as possible to air).</p>

<p>To see how compensation can take place in such a situation, first consider the hypothetical
arrangement sketched in Fig. 5.11 in which a small volume of air is defined by ideal
electrodes that are transparent to both gamma rays and electrons.</p>

<p><img src="fig5.11.png" width="538" height="322" alt=""></p>

If this test volume is at
the center of a large volume of air that is subject to the same exposure, the compensation
previously described will take place. For gamma-ray energies greater than a few hundred
\(keV\), however, the extended range of the secondary electrons makes the required surrounding
volume of air much too large. The test volume would have to be at the center of
a room-sized volume of air throughout which the exposure is the same as at the test volume
itself. In practical situations uniform exposure conditions seldom exist over such large
volumes.

<p>The situation could be improved by compressing the air surrounding the test volume
into a shell, which could then be no more than a centimeter or two in thickness. Because the
same number of air molecules would still be present, none of the compensation properties
would change and the test volume would still register an accurate measure of gamma-ray
exposure. Now the demands of uniformity could be greatly relaxed to requiring only that
the exposure be uniform over the much smaller volume defined by the shell of compressed
air. Under these conditions, all ionization lost from the test volume will be compensated by
ionization from secondary electrons created within the compressed air shell.</p>

<p>It is now only one step further to replace the hypothetical compressed air shell with a
more practical wall of solid material (see Fig. 5.11). The wall is said to be <i>air equivalent</i> if
its compensation properties are similar to those of an air layer. This condition will be met
provided the secondary electron yield and rate of electron energy loss per unit mass are
similar to those of air. Because both these phenomena depend largely on atomic number,
it turns out that virtually any material with atomic number close to that of air (such as aluminum
or plastics) is reasonably air equivalent.</p>

<p>If the walls are sufficiently thick compared with secondary electron ranges, a condition
of <i>electronic equilibrium</i> is established in which the flux of secondary electrons leaving the
inner surface of the wall becomes independent of the wall thickness. Neglecting attenuation
of the incident gamma-ray beam in the wall, the measured ion current from a chamber
of constant air volume will then be the same, independent of the wall thickness.
Table 5.2 lists the minimum air-equivalent wall thickness required to establish electronic
equilibrium. For ordinary gamma-ray energies, this thickness is \(1 cm\) or less.</p>

<p><img src="tab5.2.png" width="425" height="442" alt=""></p>

<p>For an air-equivalent ion chamber, the exposure rate \(R\) in \(C/kg\cdot s\) is simply given by
the ratio of the saturated ion current \(I_s\) (in \(amperes\)) to the mass \(M\) (in \(kg\)) contained in the
active volume:
\[
R = \frac{I_s}{M} \tag{5.9}
\]

The air mass \(M\) is normally calculated from a measurement of the chamber volume and the
density at STP,
\[
M = 1.293\frac{kg}{m^3} \cdot V \cdot \frac{P}{P_0} \cdot \frac{T_0}{T} \tag{5.10} 
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
V &=& {\rm chamber \, volume \, (in \, m^3)} \\
P &=& {\rm air \, pressure \, within \, the \, chamber} \\
P_0 &=& {\rm standard \, pressure \, (760 mm Hg, \, or \, 1.013 \times 10^5 Pa)} \\
T &=& {\rm air \, temperature \, within \, the \, chamber} \\
T_0 &=& {\rm standard \, temperature \, (273.15 K)}
\end{eqnarray}

In routine monitoring, exposure rates of the order of \(10^{-3} roentgens/hour\) 
(\(7.167 \times 10^{-11} C/kg\cdot s\)) are of typical interest. For an ion chamber of \(1000 cm^3\) volume, the saturated
ion current at standard temperature and pressure calculated from Eqs. (5.9) and
(5.10) is \(9.27 \times 10^{-14} A\). Because this signal current is very low, sensitive electrometers and
careful chamber design are required to minimize leakage currents.</p>

<p>From Eq. (5.9), the ion current \(I_s\) expected is simply proportional to the mass of the gas
within the chamber. Therefore it can only be enhanced by increasing either the chamber
volume or pressure. Thus ion chambers designed to measure very low exposure rates are
routinely filled to a high pressure to raise their sensitivity. Because of the increased frequency
of collisions in the gas at high pressures, argon is often then substituted for air to
avoid the greater recombination rate that accompanies negative ion formation.</p>

<h3>B. Absorbed Dose</h3>
Gas-filled ionization chambers can also be applied indirectly to the measurement of
absorbed dose (the energy absorbed per unit mass) in arbitrary materials. The technique is
based on application of the <i>Bragg-Gray principle</i>, which states that the absorbed dose \(D_m\)
in a given material can be deduced from the ionization produced in a small gas-filled cavity
within that material as follows:
\[
D_m = WS_mP \tag{5.11}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
W &=& {\rm average \, energy \, loss \, per \, ion \, pair \, formed \, in \, the \, gas} \\
S_m &=& {\rm relative\,mass\,stopping\,power(energy\,loss\,per\,unit\,density)\,of\,the\,material\,to\,that\,of\,the\,gas} \\
P &=& {\rm number \, of \, ion \, pairs \, per \, unit \, mass \, formed \, in \, the \, gas}
\end{eqnarray}

In order for the dose \(D_m\) to be measured in grays (\(J/kg\)), \(W\) must be expressed in \(J/{\rm ion\,pair}\)
and \(P\) in \({\rm ion\,pairs}/kg\). Equation (5.11) holds to good approximation for different types of
radiation provided several geometric conditions are met. The cavity should be small compared
with the range of the primary or secondary charged particles associated with the
radiation so that its presence does not greatly affect the particle flux. In the case of gamma
rays, the solid medium should also be large compared with the range of the secondary electrons
so that electronic equilibrium is established at the inner walls of the cavity.

<p>For an ion chamber, the solid medium is the wall material and the cavity is its internal
gas-filled volume. If the gas is air and the wall is air-equivalent material, the factor \(S_m\) in
Eq. (5.11) is unity. These are the conditions necessary for measurement of absorbed dose
in air, which is equivalent to measurement of the gamma-ray exposure discussed in the previous
section. If other wall materials or gases are used, the absorbed dose in the wall can
be calculated by inserting appropriate values for \(W\) and \(S_m\) in Eq. (5.11). The dose in biological
tissue is of particular interest in radiation protection, so that "tissue-equivalent" ion
chambers are widely applied in which the wall is made from a material with an elemental
composition similar to that of tissue.</p>

<p>In some applications, there is a problem in keeping the cavity small enough so that the
Bragg-Gray principle applies. For example, if the spectrum of gamma rays under measurement
extends to very low photon energies, the corresponding secondary electron ranges
will be short. An ion chamber with small internal dimensions compared with these ranges
would result in very small ion currents, which may cause measurement difficulties. In these
applications, use can be made of the "extrapolation chamber," which consists of a pair of
electrodes made from the material of interest mounted with variable spacing between
them. A series of measurements can be carried out with different electrode spacings and
the measured ion current per unit volume extrapolated to the case of zero spacing. With a
vanishingly small cavity, the Bragg-Gray principle is once again applicable and the
absorbed dose rate can be calculated from this extrapolated ion current.</p>
