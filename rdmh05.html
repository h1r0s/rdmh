<h1>Ionization Chambers</h1>
Several of the oldest and most widely used types of radiation detectors are based on the
effects produced when a charged particle passes through a gas.The primary modes of interaction
involve ionization and excitation of gas molecules along the particle track. Although
the excited molecules can at times be used to derive an appropriate signal (as in the gas
scintillators discussed in Chapter 8), the majority of gas-filled detectors are based on sensing
the direct ionization created by the passage of the radiation. The detectors that are the
topic of the following three chapters (ion chambers, proportional counters, Geiger tubes)
all derive, in somewhat different ways, an electronic output signal that originates with the
ion pairs formed within the gas filling the detector.

<p>Ion chambers in principle are the simplest of all gas-filled detectors. Their normal operation
is based on collection of all the charges created by direct ionization within the gas
through the application of an electric field. As with other detectors, ion chambers can be
operated in current or pulse mode. In most common applications, ion chambers are used in
current mode as dc devices, although some examples of pulse mode applications will be
given at the end of this chapter. In contrast, proportional counters or Geiger tubes are
almost always used in pulse mode.</p>

<p>The term <i>ionization chamber</i> has conventionally come to be used exclusively for the
type of detector in which ion pairs are collected from gases. The corresponding process in
solids is the collection of electron-hole pairs in the semiconductor detectors described in
Chapters 11-13. Direct ionization is only rarely exploited in liquids, although some developments
of this type are described in Chapter 19.</p>

<p>Many details that are omitted in the following discussions can be found in the classic
books on ionization chambers by Rossi and Staub and by Wilkinson More specific
descriptions of chamber design and construction are included in other books, of which
Refs. 3-5 are representative examples.</p>

<h2>I. THE IONIZATION PROCESS IN GASES</h2>
As a fast charged particle passes through a gas, the types of interaction detailed in Chapter 2
create both excited molecules and ionized molecules along its path. After a neutral molecule
is ionized, the resulting positive ion and free electron are called an <i>ion pair</i>, and it serves
as the basic constituent of the electrical signal developed by the ion chamber. Ions can be
formed either by direct interaction with the incident particle, or through a secondary
process in which some of the particle energy is first transferred to an energetic electron or
"delta ray" (see Chapter 2). Regardless of the detailed mechanisms involved, the practical
quantity of interest is the total number of ion pairs created along the track of the radiation.

<h3>A. Number of Ion Pairs Formed</h3>
At a minimum, the particle must transfer an amount of energy equal to the ionization energy
of the gas molecule to permit the ionization process to occur. In most gases of interest for
radiation detectors, the ionization energy for the least tightly bound electron shells is
between 10 and 25 \(eV\). However, there are other mechanisms by which the incident particle
may lose energy within the gas that do not create ions. Examples are excitation processes
in which an electron may be elevated to a higher bound state in the molecule without
being completely removed. Therefore, the average energy lost by the incident particle per
ion pair formed (defined as the <i>W-value</i>) is always substantially greater than the ionization
energy. The \(W\)-value is in principle a function of the species of gas involved, the type of
radiation, and its energy. Empirical observations, however, show that it is not a strong function
of any of these variables and is a remarkably constant parameter for many gases and
different types of radiation. Some specific data are shown in Table 5.1, and a typical value
is 25-35 \(eV/ion\,pair\). Therefore, an incident \(1 MeV\) particle, if it is fully stopped within the
gas, will create about 30,000 ion pairs. Assuming that \(W\) is constant for a given type of radiation,
the deposited energy will be proportional to the number of ion pairs formed and can
be determined if a corresponding measurement of the number of ion pairs is carried out.

<p><img src="tab5.1.png" width="531" height="341" alt=""></p>

<h3>B. The Fano Factor</h3>
In addition to the mean number of ion pairs formed by each incident particle, the fluctuation
in their number for incident particles of identical energy is also of interest. These fluctuations
will set a fundamental limit on the energy resolution that can be achieved in any
detector based on collection of the ions. In the simplest model, the formation of each ion
pair will be considered a Poisson process. The total number of ion pairs formed should
therefore be subject to fluctuations characterized by a standard deviation equal to the
square root of the average number formed. As discussed in Chapter 4, many radiation
detectors show an inherent fluctuation that is less than predicted by this simplified model.
The <i>Fano factor</i> is introduced as an empirical constant by which the predicted variance
must be multiplied to give the experimentally observed variance [see Eq. (4.14)].

<p>The Fano factor reflects to some degree the fraction of all the incident particle energy
that is converted into information carriers within the detector. If the entire energy of the
incident radiation were always converted into ion pairs, the number of pairs produced
would always be precisely the same and there would be no statistical fluctuation. Under
these conditions the Fano factor would be zero. If only a very small fraction of the incident
radiation is converted, however, then the ion pairs would be formed far apart and with a
relatively low probability, and there would be a good reason to expect that the distribution
in their number should follow a Poisson distribution. In gases, the Fano factor is empirically
observed to be less than 1 so that the fluctuations are smaller than would be predicted
based on Poisson statistics alone.</p>

<p>The Fano factor has significance only when the detector is operated in pulse mode. We
therefore postpone further discussions of its magnitude in gases to the following chapter
on proportional counters, where pulse mode operation and good energy resolution are
more important considerations.</p>

<h3>C. Diffusion, Charge Transfer, and Recombination</h3>
The neutral atoms or molecules of the gas are in constant thermal motion, characterized by
a mean free path for typical gases under standard conditions of about \(10^{-6} - 10^{-8} m\). Positive
ions or free electrons created within the gas also take part in the random thermal motion
and therefore have some tendency to diffuse away from regions of high density. This diffusion
process is much more pronounced for free electrons than for ions since their average
thermal velocity is much greater. A point-like collection of free electrons will spread about
the original point into a Gaussian spatial distribution whose width will increase with time.
If we let \(\sigma\) be the standard deviation of this distribution as projected onto an arbitrary
orthogonal axis (\(x\), \(y\), or \(z\)), and \(t\) be the elapsed time, then it can be shown that
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{Dt} \tag{5.1}
\]

The value of the diffusion coefficient \(D\) in simple cases can be predicted from kinetic gas
theory, but in general, a more complex transport model is required to accurately model
experimental observation.

<p>Of the many types of collisions that will normally take place between free electrons,
ions, and neutral gas molecules, several that are important in understanding the behavior
of gas-filled detectors are shown schematically in Fig. 5.1. </p>

<p><img src="fig5.1.png" width="538" height="385" alt=""></p>

<i>Charge transfer collisions</i> can occur when a positive ion 
encounters another neutral gas molecule. In such a collision. an
electron is transferred from the neutral molecule to the ion, thereby reversing the roles of
each. This charge transfer is particularly significant in gas mixtures containing several different
molecular species. There will then be a tendency to transfer the net positive charge
to the gas with the lowest ionization energy because energy is liberated in collisions which
leave that species as the positive ion.

<p>The free electron member of the original ion pair also undergoes many collisions in its
normal diffusion. In some species of gas, there may be a tendency to form negative ions by
the attachment of the free electron to a neutral gas molecule. This negative ion then shares
many properties with the original positive ion formed in the ionization process, but with
opposite electric charge. Oxygen is an example of a gas that readily attaches electrons, so
that free electrons diffusing in air are rapidly converted to negative ions. In contrast, nitrogen,
hydrogen, hydrocarbon gases, and noble gases all are characterized by relatively low
electron attachment coefficients, and therefore the electron continues to migrate in these
gases as a free electron under normal conditions.</p>

<p>Collisions between positive ions and free electrons may result in recombination in
which the electron is captured by the positive ion and returns it to a state of charge neutrality.
Alternatively, the positive ion may undergo a collision with a negative ion in which
the extra electron is transferred to the positive ion and both ions are neutralized. In either
case, the charge represented by the original pair is lost and cannot contribute further to the
signal in detectors based on collection of the ionization charge.</p>

<p>Because the collision frequency is proportional to the product of the concentrations of
the two species involved, the recombination rate can be written
\[
\frac{dn^+}{dt} = \frac{dn^-}{dt} = -\alpha n^+ n^- \tag{5.2}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
n^+ &=& {\rm number \, density \, of \, positive \, species} \\
n^- &=& {\rm number \, density \, of \, negative \, species} \\
\alpha &=& {\rm recombination \, coefficient}
\end{eqnarray}

The recombination coefficient is normally orders of magnitude larger between positive
ions and negative ions compared with that between positive ions and free electrons. In
gases that readily form negative ions through electron attachment, virtually all the recombination
takes place between positive and negative ions.</p>

<p>There are two general types of recombination loss: <i>columnar</i> recombination and <i>volume</i>
recombination. The first type (sometimes also called <i>initial</i> recombination) arises from
the fact that ion pairs are first formed in a column along the track of the ionizing particle.
The local density of ion pairs is therefore high along the track until the ion pairs are caused
to drift or diffuse away from their point of formation. Columnar recombination is most
severe for densely ionizing particles such as alpha particles or fission fragments compared
with fast electrons that deposit their energy over a much longer track. This loss mechanism
is dependent only on the local conditions along individual tracks and does not depend on
the rate at which such tracks are formed within the detector volume. In contrast, volume
recombination is due to encounters between ions and/or electrons after they have left the
immediate location of the track. Since many tracks are typically formed over the time it
takes for ions to drift all the way to the collecting electrodes, it is possible for ions and/or
electrons from independent tracks to collide and recombine. Volume recombination therefore
increases in importance with irradiation rate. Thus charge separation and collection
should be as rapid as possible in order to minimize recombination, and high electric fields
are indicated for this purpose.</p>

<h2>II. CHARGE MIGRATION AND COLLECTION</h2>
<h3>A. Charge Mobility</h3>
If an external electric field is applied to the region in which ions or electrons exist in the
gas, electrostatic forces will tend to move the charges away from their point of origin. The
net motion consists of a superposition of a random thermal velocity together with a net
drift velocity in a given direction. The drift velocity for positive ions is in the direction of
the conventional electric field, whereas free electrons and negative ions drift in the opposite
direction.

<p>For ions in a gas, the drift velocity can be fairly accurately predicted from the relation
\[
v = \frac{\mu\mathscr{E}}{p} \tag{5.3}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
v &=& {\rm drift \, velocity} \\
\mathscr{E} &=& {\rm electric \, field \, strength} \\
p &=& {\rm gas \, pressure}
\end{eqnarray}

The mobility \(\mu\) tends to remain fairly constant over wide ranges of electric field and gas
pressure and does not differ greatly for either positive or negative ions in the same gas.
Tabulated values for the mobility of ions in various gases can be found in Ref. 2. Typical
values are between 1 and \(1.5 \times 10^{-4} m^2 atom/V\cdot s\) for detector gases of medium atomic
number. Therefore, at 1 atm pressure, a typical electric field of \(10^4 V/m\) will result in a drift
velocity of the order of \(1 m/s\). Ion transit times over typical detector dimensions of a centimeter
will therefore be approximately \(10 ms\). By most standards, this is a very long time.</p>

<p>Free electrons behave quite differently. Their much lower mass allows a greater acceleration
between encounters with neutral gas molecules, and the value of the mobility in
Eq. (5.3) is typically 1000 times greater than that for ions. Typical collection times for electrons
are therefore of the order of microseconds, rather than milliseconds. In some gases,
for example, hydrocarbons and argon-hydrocarbon mixtures, there is a saturation effect in
the electric drift velocity (see Fig. 5.2).</p>

<p><img src="fig5.2.png" width="481" height="324" alt=""></p>

Its value approaches a maximum for high values of
the electric field and may even decrease slightly if the field is further increased. In many
other gases (see Fig. 6.15), the electron drift velocity continues to increase for the largest
\(\mathscr{E}/p\) values likely to be used in gas-filled counters.

<p>As the electrons are drifting through the gas under the influence of the electric field,
they will to first approximation follow the path of the electric field line that passes through
their point of origin (but in the reverse direction to the electric field vector). Random diffusion
of the electrons will still be taking place, however, causing each individual electron
to follow a slightly different path. For strong electric field values, the increased average
energy given the electron in the direction of the field results in different values of the diffusion
coefficient [\(D\) in Eq. (5.1)] for the directions that are parallel to or transverse to the
field. Over the few microseconds that are typically required for the electrons to reach a collecting
electrode, the diffusion in either direction might be of the order of a millimeter or
less. While in most standard detectors this charge spreading will have little practical effect,
it does play a potential role in limiting the position resolution attainable in "position-sensitive"
gas detectors that deduce the location of the ionizing event through the position
of arrival of the electrons at the anode, or through measuring the electron drift time.</p>

<h3>B. The Ionization Current</h3>
In the presence of an electric field, the drift of the positive and negative charges represented
by the ions and electrons constitutes an electric current. If a given volume of gas is
undergoing steady-state irradiation, the rate of formation of ion pairs is constant. For any
small test volume of the gas, this rate of formation will be exactly balanced by the rate at
which ion pairs are lost from the volume, either through recombination or by diffusion or
migration from the volume. Under the conditions that recombination is negligible and all
the charges are efficiently collected, the steady-state current produced is an accurate measure
of the rate at which ion pairs are formed within the volume. Measurement of this <i>ionization
current</i> is the basic principle of the dc ion chamber.

<p><img src="fig5.3.png" width="499" height="430" alt=""></p>

<p>Figure 5.3 illustrates the basic elements of a rudimentary ion chamber. A volume of gas
is enclosed within a region in which an electric field can be created by the application of an
external voltage. At equilibrium, the current flowing in the external circuit will be equal to
the ionization current collected at the electrodes, and a sensitive ammeter placed in the
external circuit can therefore measure the ionization current.</p>

<p>The current-voltage characteristics of such a chamber are also sketched in Fig. 5.3.
Neglecting some subtle effects related to differences in diffusion characteristics between
ions and electrons, no net current should flow in the absence of an applied voltage because
no electric field will then exist within the gas. Ions and electrons that are created ultimately
disappear either by recombination or by diffusion from the active volume. As the voltage is
increased, the resulting electric field begins to separate the ion pairs more rapidly, and
columnar recombination is diminished. The positive and negative charges are also swept
toward the respective electrodes with increasing drift velocity, reducing the equilibrium
concentration of ions within the gas and therefore further suppressing volume recombination
between the point of origin and the collecting electrodes. The measured current thus
increases with applied voltage as these effects reduce the amount of the original charge
that is lost. At a sufficiently high applied voltage, the electric field is large enough to effectively
suppress recombination to a negligible level, and all the original charges created
through the ionization process contribute to the ion current. Increasing the voltage further
cannot increase the current because all charges are already collected and their rate of formation
is constant. This is the region of <i>ion saturation</i> in which ion chambers are conventionally
operated. Under these conditions, the current measured in the external circuit is a
true indication of the rate of formation of all charges due to ionization within the active
volume of the chamber.</p>

<h3>C. Factors Affecting the Saturation Current</h3>
Several factors can detract from reaching saturation current in an ion chamber. The most
important of these is recombination, which is minimized by ensuring that a large value of
the electric field exists everywhere within the ion chamber volume. Columnar recombination
along the track of heavy charged particles (such as alpha particles or fission fragments)
is particularly significant, so that larger values of the applied voltage are required in these
cases to achieve saturation, compared with electron or gamma-ray irradiation. Also, the
effects of volume recombination are more important for higher intensity of the irradiation
(and thus higher ion currents), as illustrated in Fig. 5.4. 

<p><img src="fig5.4.png" width="491" height="285" alt=""></p>

Here the percentage by which the
measured current falls short of true saturation is seen to increase as a function of the measured
ion current. At the lower irradiation levels, the density of ions and electrons (or negative
ions) is correspondingly low, and from Eq. (5.2), the recombination rate is less
significant than at high rates. Thus higher voltages are required at high irradiation rates to
approach the true saturated ion current. This dependence is evident in the current-voltage
characteristics shown in Fig. 5.3 and also is apparent in the example of an ionization chamber
used for neutron monitoring shown in Fig. 14.14. In chambers operated with ambient air
as the fill gas, increases in the humidity level will also raise the volume recombination rate.

<p>If the production of ion pairs is uniform throughout the volume of the ion chamber,
the drift of positive charges toward the cathode and negative charges toward the anode will
create some imbalance in the steady-state concentrations of the two charge carriers. The
concentration of positive ions will be greatest near the cathode; the opposite is true for the
negative charges. Wherever a gradient exists for a species that is free to migrate, some net
diffusion must take place in the direction of decreasing concentration. The direction of diffusion
is therefore opposite that of the charge carrier flow caused by the electric field, and
the effect can be to reduce the measured ion current. From an analysis given by Rossi and
Staub the perturbation in the measured ion current is given by
\[
-\frac{\Delta I}{I} = \frac{\epsilon kT}{eV} \tag{5.4}
\]

where parallel planar electrodes have been assumed. In this expression,
\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon &=& {\rm ratio\,of\,the\,average\,energy\,of\,charge\,carrier\,with\,electric\,field\,present\,to\,that\,without\,the\,electric\,field}\\
k &=& {\rm Boltzmann \, constant} \\
T &=& {\rm absolute \, temperature} \\
e &=& {\rm electronic \, charge} \\
V &=& {\rm applied \, voltage \, between \, electrodes}
\end{eqnarray}

The size of this loss in the saturation current depends primarily on the applied voltage and
the size of the quantity \(\epsilon\) defined above. At room temperature, the factor \(kT/e\) is approximately
\(2.5 \times 10^{-2}V\). For ions, \(\epsilon\) is not much larger than unity, and Eq. (5.4) therefore predicts
that the loss due to diffusion is negligible even for low values of the applied voltage.
When the negative charge is carried by free electrons, however, \(\epsilon\) can be of the order of several
hundred and a significant loss in saturation current due to electron diffusion is possible.
Because \(\epsilon\) will tend toward a limiting saturated value as the voltage \(V\) is raised to high values,
the loss is minimized by operating the chamber at high values of the applied voltage</p>

<p>In many cases, losses due to diffusion and volume recombination can be reduced to
insignificant levels at reasonable values of the applied voltage. Columnar recombination is
more difficult to eliminate completely, and small losses may persist even at the highest
available voltages. It is then helpful to make a number of measurements of the ionization
current as a function of voltage in order to determine the true saturated current. It has
been shown that under these conditions a plot of \(1/I\) versus \(1/V\) can be used to extrapolate
the measurements to zero on the \(1/V\) axis (infinite electric field) to make an accurate
prediction of the saturated value of the current.</p>

<h2>III. DESIGN AND OPERATION OF DC ION CHAMBERS</h2>

<h3>A. General Considerations</h3>
When an ion chamber is used in direct current mode, it is possible to collect the negative
charges either as free electrons or as negative ions. Therefore, virtually any fill gas can be
used for the chamber, including those that have high electron attachment coefficients.
Although recombination is more significant when negative ions are formed, diffusion losses
are less important. Conditions of saturation can normally be achieved over dimensions of
a few centimeters using applied voltages that are no greater than tens or hundreds of volts.
Air is the most common fill gas and is one in which negative ions are readily formed. Air
is required in those chambers designed for the measurement of gamma-ray exposure (see
p. 140). Denser gases such as argon are sometimes chosen in other applications to increase
the ionization density within a given volume. The fill gas pressure is often 1 atmosphere,
although higher pressures are sometimes used to increase the sensitivity.

<p>The geometry chosen for an ion chamber can be varied greatly to suit the application,
provided the electric field throughout the active volume can be maintained high enough to
lead to saturation of the ion current. Parallel plate or planar geometry leads to a uniform
electric field between the plates. Also common is a cylindrical geometry in which the outer
shell of the cylinder is operated at ground potential and an axial conducting rod carries the
applied voltage. In this case, a field that varies inversely with radius is created. Analytical
methods that can be used to predict the current-voltage characteristics of chambers of various
geometries are described in Ref. 11.</p>

<h3>B. Insulators and Guard Rings</h3>
With any design, some sort of supporting insulator must be provided between the two electrodes.
Because typical ionization currents in most applications are extremely small (of the
order of \(10^{-12}A\) or less), the leakage current through these insulators must be kept very
small. In the simple scheme of Fig. 5.3, any leakage through the insulator will add to the
measured ionization current and cause an unwanted component of the signal. In order to
keep this component below 1% of an ionization current of \(10^{-12} A\) for an applied voltage
of \(100 V\), the resistance of the insulator would need to be greater than \(10^{16} ohms\). Although
it may be possible to find materials with bulk resistivity sufficiently high to meet this criterion,
leakage paths across the surface of the insulator due to absorbed moisture or other
contaminants almost always represent a lower resistance. A different design is therefore
often used in low-current applications of ion chambers in which a <i>guard ring</i> is employed
to reduce the effects of insulator leakage.

<p><img src="fig5.5.png" width="509" height="309" alt=""></p>

<p>A diagram illustrating the use of a guard ring is shown in Fig. 5.5. The insulator is now
segmented into two parts, one part separating the conducting guard ring from the negative
electrode and the other part separating it from the positive electrode. Most of the voltage
drop occurs across the outer segment in which the resulting leakage current does not pass
through the measuring instrument. The voltage drop across the inner segment is only the
voltage difference across the ammeter terminals and can be very small. Therefore, the component
of leakage current which is added to the signal is greatly reduced compared with
the case without the guard ring.</p>

<p>Insulators for applications that do not involve high radiation fields are normally manufactured
from one of the high-resistivity synthetic plastics. Care is taken to keep the
surface smooth and as free of defects as possible in order to minimize the amount of moisture
absorption. Radiation damage in these materials in high radiation applications (such
as in reactor instruments) can lead to rapid deterioration of the insulation properties. In
such cases, inorganic materials such as ceramics are preferred because of their higher
resistance to radiation damage.</p>

<h3>C. Measurement of the Ion Current</h3>
The magnitude of the ionization current under typical conditions is much too small to be
measured using standard galvanometer techniques. Instead, some active amplification of
the current must be carried out to allow its indirect measurement. An electrometer indirectly
measures the current by sensing the voltage drop across a series resistance placed in
the measuring circuit (see Fig. 5.6). 

<p><img src="fig5.6.png" width="557" height="212" alt=""></p>

The voltage developed across the resistor (typicallv
with a value of \(10^9-10^{12} ohms\)) can be amplified and serves as the basis for the measured
signal. One weakness of standard electrometer circuits is that they must be dc coupled
throughout. Any small drift or gradual change in component values therefore results in a
corresponding change in the measured output current. Thus, circuits of this type must frequently
be balanced by shorting the input and resetting the scale to zero.

<p>An alternative approach is to convert the signal from dc to ac at an early stage, which
then allows a more stable amplification of the ac signal in subsequent stages. This conversion
is accomplished in the <i>dynamic-capacitor</i> or <i>vibrating reed</i> electrometer by collecting
the ion current across an \(RC\) circuit with long time constant, as shown in Fig. 5.7. </p>

<p><img src="fig5.7.png" width="512" height="210" alt=""></p>


At equilibrium, a constant voltage is developed across this circuit, which is given by
\[
V = IR \tag{5.5}
\]

where \(I\) is the steady-state ionization current. A charge \(Q\) is stored on the capacitance,
which is given by
\[
Q = CV \tag{5.6}
\]

If the capacitance is now caused to change rapidly compared with the time constant of the
circuit, a corresponding change will be induced in the voltage across \(C\) given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta V &=& \frac{Q}{C^2}\Delta C \\
\Delta V &=& I\frac{R}{C}\Delta C \tag{5.7}
\end{eqnarray}

If the value of the capacitance is varied sinusoidally about an average value \(C\), the amplitude
of the ac voltage that is induced is therefore proportional to the ionization current.

<p>The average ionization current can also be measured over finite periods of time by
integration methods. If the value of \(R\) in Fig. 5.6 is made infinite, any ionization current
from the chamber is simply integrated across the capacitance \(C\). By noting the change in
the voltage across the capacitance over the measurement period, the total integrated ionization
current or ionization charge can be deduced. If the amount of natural leakage
across the capacitance can be kept small, this integration technique has the potential of
being able to measure much smaller ionization currents than through direct dc current
measurement.</p>

<p><img src="fig5.8.png" width="556" height="194" alt=""></p>

<p>To illustrate, suppose that the ion chamber of Fig. 5.8 is originally charged to a voltage
\(V_0\). If the leakage across the chamber insulators and external capacitor is negligible, this
voltage would be maintained at its original value indefinitely in the absence of ionizing
radiation. If radiation is present, the ions will act to partially discharge the capacitance and
reduce the voltage from its original value. If a charge \(\Delta Q\) (defined either as the positive
charge of the positive ions or the negative charge of the electrons) is created by the
radiation, then the total charge stored on the capacitance will be reduced by \(\Delta Q\). The voltage
will therefore drop from its original value of \(V_0\) by an amount \(\Delta V\) given by
\[
\Delta V = \frac{\Delta Q}{C} \tag{5.8}
\]

A measurement of \(\Delta V\) thus gives the total ionization charge or the integrated ionization
current over the period of the measurement.</p>

<h3>D. The Electret</h3>
The previous section described the measurement of ionization current integrated over a
period of time by noting the drop in voltage measured across the chamber capacitance
after an initial charging to a known voltage. A similar measurement can be carried out by
noting the drop in surface voltage on an element known as an <i>electret</i> that is placed
inside an ion chamber. An electret is a sample of dielectric material (commonly Teflon)
that carries a quasi-permanent electrical charge. A disk of the material of approximately
\(1cm\) diameter and \(1mm\) thickness is fabricated by heating in the presence of an electric
field and then cooling to "freeze" electric dipoles in place. A voltage of up to \(1000 V\) may
then appear between the opposite surfaces of the electret. With proper encapsulation, this
stored charge may be stable over periods of a year or more, even in the presence of high
humidity.

<p>An electret placed with one of its surfaces in contact with the conducting walls of an ion
chamber will create an electric field throughout the chamber volume because of the voltage
difference on its opposite surface. Any ion pairs created by radiation within the chamber
will be separated and collected by this field, serving to partially neutralize the charge carried
by the electret. Measurements of the electret voltage before and after the exposure can
then be calibrated in terms of the total ionization charge produced in the chamber.</p>

<h2>IV. RADIATION DOSE MEASUREMENT WITH ION CHAMBERS</h2>

<h3>A. Gamma-Ray Exposure</h3>
One of the most important applications of ion chambers is in the measurement of gamma-ray
exposure. An air-filled ion chamber is particularly well-suited for this application
because exposure is defined in terms of the amount of ionization charge created in air.
Under the proper conditions a determination of the ionization charge in an air-filled ionization
chamber can give an accurate measure of the exposure, and a measurement of the
ionization current will indicate the exposure rate.

<p>The task of measuring exposure is somewhat more complicated than it might first
appear, because it is defined in terms of the ionization created by all the secondary electrons
generated at the point at which the dose is to be measured. Strictly speaking, one
would need to follow each of these secondary electrons over its entire range and measure
all the ionization created along its track. Because the range in air of secondary electrons
created by typical gamma-ray energies can be several meters, it is impractical to design an
instrument that would carry out such a measurement directly. Instead, the principle of compensation
is used.</p>

<p>If the test volume of air is surrounded by an infinite sea of equivalent air that is also
subject to the same exposure over the course of the measurement, an exact compensation
will occur. That is, all the ionization charge created outside the test volume from secondary
electrons that were formed within the volume is exactly balanced by charge created within
the test volume from secondary electrons formed in the surrounding air. This situation is
illustrated in Fig. 5.9.</p>

<p><img src="fig5.9.png" width="515" height="632" alt=""></p>

<p>One popular design based on this compensation is diagrammed in Fig. 5.10 and is
called the <i>free-air ionization chamber</i>.</p>

<p><img src="fig5.10.png" width="518" height="347" alt=""></p>

Each end of the chamber is rendered insensitive by
grounding the guard electrodes shown in the diagram. The parallel plate geometry creates
electric field lines that are perpendicular to the plates in the space between them, but only
the volume defined by the central electrode collects ionization current that is registered by
the external circuit. The incident gamma-ray beam is collimated so that it is confined to a
region that is far from the chamber electrodes, and secondary electrons created in the sensitive
volume cannot reach either electrode. Compensation is therefore not required in the
vertical dimension but will take place in the horizontal dimension, provided the intensity
of the incident radiation beam is not appreciably reduced in its passage through the
chamber. Free-air ionization chambers are widely used for accurate exposure measurements
for gamma-ray energies below about \(100 keV\).

<p>At higher energies, the larger range of the secondary electrons creates some difficulties.
In order to prevent ionization loss from secondary electrons reaching the electrodes,
the dimensions of the chamber must become impractically large. Therefore, gamma-ray
exposure measurements at higher energies are conventionally carried out in cavity chambers
in which a small volume of air is surrounded by a solid material (chosen because its
properties are as similar as possible to air).</p>

<p>To see how compensation can take place in such a situation, first consider the hypothetical
arrangement sketched in Fig. 5.11 in which a small volume of air is defined by ideal
electrodes that are transparent to both gamma rays and electrons.</p>

<p><img src="fig5.11.png" width="538" height="322" alt=""></p>

If this test volume is at
the center of a large volume of air that is subject to the same exposure, the compensation
previously described will take place. For gamma-ray energies greater than a few hundred
\(keV\), however, the extended range of the secondary electrons makes the required surrounding
volume of air much too large. The test volume would have to be at the center of
a room-sized volume of air throughout which the exposure is the same as at the test volume
itself. In practical situations uniform exposure conditions seldom exist over such large
volumes.

<p>The situation could be improved by compressing the air surrounding the test volume
into a shell, which could then be no more than a centimeter or two in thickness. Because the
same number of air molecules would still be present, none of the compensation properties
would change and the test volume would still register an accurate measure of gamma-ray
exposure. Now the demands of uniformity could be greatly relaxed to requiring only that
the exposure be uniform over the much smaller volume defined by the shell of compressed
air. Under these conditions, all ionization lost from the test volume will be compensated by
ionization from secondary electrons created within the compressed air shell.</p>

<p>It is now only one step further to replace the hypothetical compressed air shell with a
more practical wall of solid material (see Fig. 5.11). The wall is said to be <i>air equivalent</i> if
its compensation properties are similar to those of an air layer. This condition will be met
provided the secondary electron yield and rate of electron energy loss per unit mass are
similar to those of air. Because both these phenomena depend largely on atomic number,
it turns out that virtually any material with atomic number close to that of air (such as aluminum
or plastics) is reasonably air equivalent.</p>

<p>If the walls are sufficiently thick compared with secondary electron ranges, a condition
of <i>electronic equilibrium</i> is established in which the flux of secondary electrons leaving the
inner surface of the wall becomes independent of the wall thickness. Neglecting attenuation
of the incident gamma-ray beam in the wall, the measured ion current from a chamber
of constant air volume will then be the same, independent of the wall thickness.
Table 5.2 lists the minimum air-equivalent wall thickness required to establish electronic
equilibrium. For ordinary gamma-ray energies, this thickness is \(1 cm\) or less.</p>

<p><img src="tab5.2.png" width="425" height="442" alt=""></p>

<p>For an air-equivalent ion chamber, the exposure rate \(R\) in \(C/kg\cdot s\) is simply given by
the ratio of the saturated ion current \(I_s\) (in \(amperes\)) to the mass \(M\) (in \(kg\)) contained in the
active volume:
\[
R = \frac{I_s}{M} \tag{5.9}
\]

The air mass \(M\) is normally calculated from a measurement of the chamber volume and the
density at STP,
\[
M = 1.293\frac{kg}{m^3} \cdot V \cdot \frac{P}{P_0} \cdot \frac{T_0}{T} \tag{5.10} 
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
V &=& {\rm chamber \, volume \, (in \, m^3)} \\
P &=& {\rm air \, pressure \, within \, the \, chamber} \\
P_0 &=& {\rm standard \, pressure \, (760 mm Hg, \, or \, 1.013 \times 10^5 Pa)} \\
T &=& {\rm air \, temperature \, within \, the \, chamber} \\
T_0 &=& {\rm standard \, temperature \, (273.15 K)}
\end{eqnarray}

In routine monitoring, exposure rates of the order of \(10^{-3} roentgens/hour\) 
(\(7.167 \times 10^{-11} C/kg\cdot s\)) are of typical interest. For an ion chamber of \(1000 cm^3\) volume, the saturated
ion current at standard temperature and pressure calculated from Eqs. (5.9) and
(5.10) is \(9.27 \times 10^{-14} A\). Because this signal current is very low, sensitive electrometers and
careful chamber design are required to minimize leakage currents.</p>

<p>From Eq. (5.9), the ion current \(I_s\) expected is simply proportional to the mass of the gas
within the chamber. Therefore it can only be enhanced by increasing either the chamber
volume or pressure. Thus ion chambers designed to measure very low exposure rates are
routinely filled to a high pressure to raise their sensitivity. Because of the increased frequency
of collisions in the gas at high pressures, argon is often then substituted for air to
avoid the greater recombination rate that accompanies negative ion formation.</p>

<h3>B. Absorbed Dose</h3>
Gas-filled ionization chambers can also be applied indirectly to the measurement of
absorbed dose (the energy absorbed per unit mass) in arbitrary materials. The technique is
based on application of the <i>Bragg-Gray principle</i>, which states that the absorbed dose \(D_m\)
in a given material can be deduced from the ionization produced in a small gas-filled cavity
within that material as follows:
\[
D_m = WS_mP \tag{5.11}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
W &=& {\rm average \, energy \, loss \, per \, ion \, pair \, formed \, in \, the \, gas} \\
S_m &=& {\rm relative\,mass\,stopping\,power(energy\,loss\,per\,unit\,density)\,of\,the\,material\,to\,that\,of\,the\,gas} \\
P &=& {\rm number \, of \, ion \, pairs \, per \, unit \, mass \, formed \, in \, the \, gas}
\end{eqnarray}

In order for the dose \(D_m\) to be measured in grays (\(J/kg\)), \(W\) must be expressed in \(J/{\rm ion\,pair}\)
and \(P\) in \({\rm ion\,pairs}/kg\). Equation (5.11) holds to good approximation for different types of
radiation provided several geometric conditions are met. The cavity should be small compared
with the range of the primary or secondary charged particles associated with the
radiation so that its presence does not greatly affect the particle flux. In the case of gamma
rays, the solid medium should also be large compared with the range of the secondary electrons
so that electronic equilibrium is established at the inner walls of the cavity.

<p>For an ion chamber, the solid medium is the wall material and the cavity is its internal
gas-filled volume. If the gas is air and the wall is air-equivalent material, the factor \(S_m\) in
Eq. (5.11) is unity. These are the conditions necessary for measurement of absorbed dose
in air, which is equivalent to measurement of the gamma-ray exposure discussed in the previous
section. If other wall materials or gases are used, the absorbed dose in the wall can
be calculated by inserting appropriate values for \(W\) and \(S_m\) in Eq. (5.11). The dose in biological
tissue is of particular interest in radiation protection, so that "tissue-equivalent" ion
chambers are widely applied in which the wall is made from a material with an elemental
composition similar to that of tissue.</p>

<p>In some applications, there is a problem in keeping the cavity small enough so that the
Bragg-Gray principle applies. For example, if the spectrum of gamma rays under measurement
extends to very low photon energies, the corresponding secondary electron ranges
will be short. An ion chamber with small internal dimensions compared with these ranges
would result in very small ion currents, which may cause measurement difficulties. In these
applications, use can be made of the "extrapolation chamber," which consists of a pair of
electrodes made from the material of interest mounted with variable spacing between
them. A series of measurements can be carried out with different electrode spacings and
the measured ion current per unit volume extrapolated to the case of zero spacing. With a
vanishingly small cavity, the Bragg-Gray principle is once again applicable and the
absorbed dose rate can be calculated from this extrapolated ion current.</p>

<h2>V. APPLICATIONS OF DC ION CHAMBERS</h2>

<h3>A. Radiation Survey Instruments</h3>
Portable ion chambers of various designs are commonly used as survey instruments for
radiation monitoring purposes. These typically consist of a closed air volume of several
hundred \(cm^3\) from which the saturated ion current is measured using a battery-powered
electrometer circuit. Walls are approximately air equivalent and may be fabricated from
plastic or aluminum. These instruments give relatively accurate measurements of the exposure
for gamma-ray energies high enough to avoid significant attenuation in the walls or
entrance window of the chamber, but low enough so that electronic equilibrium is established
in the walls. Figure 5.12 shows calibration curves for two such instruments and illustrates
the drop-off in sensitivity for gamma-ray energies that are less than \(50-100 keV\) due
to window attenuation.

<p><img src="fig5.12.png" width="573" height="388" alt=""></p>

<p>Other types of portable ion chambers used for dose measurements are based on the
charge integration principle. As described previously, the chamber is initially charged,
placed in the radiation field for a period of time, and the resulting drop in chamber voltage
is used as a measure of the total integrated ionization charge. The "Condenser R-meter"
consists of a charger-reader mechanism and several interchangeable ion chambers of different
sizes and wall thicknesses. Each is designed to cover a different range of gamma-ray
energy and maximum dose. When used in the proper range, these devices can give results that
are accurate to within a few percent. Another related instrument is a small-size ion chamber
known as a "pocket chamber." These are often provided with an integral quartz fiber electroscope
that can be read on an internal scale by holding the pocket chamber up to the light.
An initial charging of the chamber zeros the scale of the electroscope. The pocket chamber
is then worn during the period of monitoring. The total integrated dose can be checked periodically
simply by noting the degree of discharge of the chamber as indicated on the electroscope.
The ultimate sensitivity of such devices is normally limited by leakage current,
which inevitably occurs across the insulator surface over long periods of time.</p>

<h3>B. Radiation Source Calibrators</h3>
Many of the common applications of ion chambers take advantage of their excellent longterm
stability. When operated in the saturated region, the ion current depends only on the
geometry of the source and detector and can remain stable over very long periods of time.
For example, the standardization of gamma-ray emitters is often carried out by comparing
the ion current from an unknown source with that generated by a standard source under
identical geometry. Typical operating characteristics can remain stable to within \(\pm 0.1\)%
over several years, eliminating the need for frequent recalibration.

<p>One specific design of such a chamber is shown in Fig. 5.13. </p>

<p><img src="fig5.13.png" width="537" height="468" alt=""></p>

Typical chamber volumes
are several thousand \(cm^3\) and the walls are usually made of brass or steel. The inner collecting
electrode is made of a thin foil of aluminum or copper to avoid unnecessary radiation
attenuation. The geometry is chosen to avoid low-field regions that could lead to
changes in the effective active volume with applied voltage. In such a chamber with a
\(10^4 cm^3\) active volume, the saturation current produced by \(1 \mu Ci (3.7 \times 10^4 Bq)\) of \(^{60}Co\) is
on the order of \(10^{-13}A\), about five times the background current. If higher sensitivity is
needed, the gas within the ion chamber may be pressurized. Raising the pressure to 20 atm
will increase the ion current by a factor of 20, but the total background arising from all
sources will increase by a lesser factor. For large chambers, the component of background
arising from alpha activity of the chamber walls should be independent of pressure, provided
the alpha particles are already fully stopped within the gas. Pressurizing the chamber,
however, requires the use of relatively thick entrance windows, which, although not
usually a problem for gamma rays, can interfere with the extension of the applications to
include pure beta-emitting isotopes.

<h3>C. Measurement of Radioactive Gases</h3>
Radioactive gases can conveniently be measured by incorporating them as a constituent of
the fill gas of an ionization chamber. Entrance and exit ports are provided to the chamber
volume to allow introduction of the gas to be sampled on a continuous flow basis.
Examples of specific ion chamber designs of this type are given in Refs. 8,18, and 19.

<p>The ionization current expected from a given quantity of radioactive gas within the
chamber is given by
\[
I = \frac{\overline{E}\alpha e}{W} \tag{5.12}
\]

where
\begin{eqnarray}
I &=& {\rm ionization \, current \, (in \, A)} \\
\overline{E} &=& {\rm average \, energy \, deposited \, in \, the \, gas \, per \, disintegration \, (in \, eV)} \\
\alpha &=& {\rm total \, activity \, (in \, Bq)} \\
e &=& {\rm electronic \, charge \, (in \, C)} \\
W &=& {\rm average \, energy \, deposited \, per \, ion \, pair \, in \, the \, gas \, (in \, eV)}
\end{eqnarray}
</p>

<p>The quantity \(\overline{E}\) is simple to predict only in the case of very small radiation energies that
are nearly always fully absorbed within the chamber gas. For example, the soft beta particles
emitted in the decay of tritium have an average energy of \(5.65 keV\), and \(\overline{E}\) can be taken
as equal to this value for chambers that are large compared with the corresponding beta
particle range in the gas. Equation (5.12) then predicts a sensitivity of about \(1 pA/\mu Ci\), or
\(2.7 \times 10^{-17} A/Bq\). Once a beta particle energy is large enough so that typical ranges are
comparable to chamber dimensions, more complex procedures are required to estimate the
average energy deposited (e.g., see Ref. 20).</p>

<p>A common application is one in which samples of air that contain trace quantities of a
radioactive gas are to be continuously monitored. When the gas that flows through the
chamber is subject to atmospheric changes, a number of difficulties can arise. These perturbing
influences can include effects due to moisture, aerosols, ions, and smoke, which
may be found in the sampled air. Prior treatment of the incoming air by filtration or electrostatic
precipitation can help to control many of these influences.</p>

<p>The chamber will also be sensitive to the ambient gamma-ray background radiation. If
constant, this background can be eliminated by simple subtraction of the signal recorded
when the chamber is filled with pure air. In other situations in which the gamma-ray background
may change during the course of the measurement, a twin chamber filled with pure
air can be used to generate a compensating signal that is subtracted from that produced by
the chamber through which the sample gas is circulated.</p>

<h3>D. Remote Sensing of Ionization</h3>
A novel application of ionization chambers has been demonstrated that exploits the fact
that positive and negative ions formed in air can survive for periods of seconds or minutes
before losing their charge to recombination. These ions can be entrained in a flow of air and,
if kept away from surfaces that enhance recombination, may be transported a substantial distance
from their point of formation. If a flow of air containing such ions is introduced into an
ion chamber, then a current will be observed resulting from the motion of these ions in its
electric field even if no ions are created within the volume of the ion chamber itself. No
radioactivity needs to be transported into the chamber, but the presence of the ions themselves
in the air stream introduced into a chamber is sufficient to create the signal.

<P>This principle is the basis of an instrument called the <I>long-range alpha detector</I> (LRAD).
Samples of materials or equipment that might be contaminated by alpha particle emitters are
placed into a container through which there is a flow of air. Since the range of the alpha particles
is only a few centimeters in air, their direct detection would require bringing a suitable
detector very near to the surface, a process that may be impractical because of inaccessibility
of the surfaces. Instead, the air stream flowing past these surfaces will pick up some of the
positive and negative ions and transport them downstream through a conventional ion chamber.
The drift of the ions in the chamber electric field takes place over milliseconds, so the
slower motion of the air flow does not play an important role in the detected signal. This
application illustrates that the ion current results from the motion of the ions within the field
of the ion chamber, regardless of where these ions were originally formed.</p>

<h2>VI. PULSE MODE OPERATION</h2>

<h3>A. General Considerations</h3>
Most applications of ionization chambers involve their use in current mode in which the
average rate of ion formation within the chamber is measured. Like many other radiation
detectors, ion chambers can also be operated in pulse mode in which each separate radiation
quantum gives rise to a distinguishable signal pulse. As outlined in Chapter 4, pulse
mode operation can offer significant advantages in sensitivity or ability to measure the
energy of the incident radiation. Pulse mode ion chambers are used to some extent in radiation
spectroscopy, although they have largely been replaced by semiconductor diode
detectors (see Chapter 11) for many such applications. However, pulse ion chambers
remain important instruments in certain specialized applications such as large-area
alpha spectrometers or in neutron detectors of the type described in Chapter 14.

<p>The equivalent circuit of an ion chamber operated in pulse mode is shown in Fig. 5.14.</p>

<p><img src="fig5.14.png" width="519" height="260" alt=""></p>

The voltage across the load resistance \(R\) is the basic electrical signal. In the absence of any
ionization charge within the ion chamber, this signal voltage is zero, and all the applied
voltage \(V_0\) appears across the ionization chamber itself. When an ionizing particle passes
through the chamber, the ion pairs that are created begin to drift under the influence of the
electric field. As will be shown in the analysis below, these drifting charges give rise to
induced charges on the electrodes of the ion chamber that reduce the ion chamber voltage
from its equilibrium value \(V_0\). A voltage then appears across the load resistance, which is
equal to the amount by which the chamber voltage has dropped. When all charges within
the chamber have been collected at the opposite electrodes, this voltage reaches its maximum
value. There then follows a slow return to equilibrium conditions on a time scale
determined by the time constant \(RC\) of the external circuit. During this period, the voltage
across the load resistance gradually drops to zero and the chamber voltage returns to its
original value \(V_0\). If the time constant of the external circuit is long compared with the time
required to collect the charges within the chamber, a signal pulse is produced whose amplitude
indicates the magnitude of the original charge generated within the ion chamber.

<p>As indicated in the earlier discussion of electron and ion mobilities in gases, typical
times required to collect free electrons over several centimeters are a few microseconds.
On the other hand, ions (either positive or negative) drift much more slowly and typically
require collection times of the order of milliseconds. Therefore, if a signal that accurately
reflects the total contribution of both the ions and electrons is to be generated, the collection
circuit time constant and subsequent pulse-shaping time constants must be long compared
with a millisecond. Under these conditions, the ion chamber must be restricted to
very low pulse rates to avoid excessive pulse pile up. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the
output of the shaping circuits to low frequencies makes the system susceptible to interference
from microphonic signals generated by mechanical vibrations within the ion chamber.</p>

<p>For these reasons, pulse-type ion chambers are more often operated in the electron-sensitive
mode. Here a time constant is chosen that is intermediate between the electron
collection time and the ion collection time. The amplitude of the pulse that is produced
then reflects only the drift of the electrons and will have much faster rise and fall times.
Shorter shaping time constants and much higher rates can therefore be tolerated. A significant
sacrifice has been made, however, in that the amplitude of the output pulse now
becomes sensitive to the position of the original radiation interaction within the chamber
and no longer reflects only the total number of ion pairs formed. The use of more complex
gridded chambers, described in a later section, can overcome this disadvantage to a large
degree. The fill gas of any electron-sensitive ion chamber must of course be chosen from
those gases in which the electrons remain as free electrons and do not form negative ions.</p>

<h3>B. Derivation of the Pulse Shape</h3>
The shape of the pulse produced from the flow of charges within detectors of arbitrary
geometry is best addressed using the <i>Shockley-Ramo theorem</i> outlined in Appendix D.
However, in the simple case of an ion chamber with parallel plate electrodes that are separated
by a small spacing compared with the length and width of the plates, edge effects
can be neglected and the analysis can be assumed to involve only one variable: the position
of the charges in the dimension perpendicular to the plates. It is instructive to then follow
a simplified derivation of the pulse shape that invokes arguments based only on the conservation
of energy. This derivation gives the correct results and avoids the mathematical
complexity that might obscure some of the physical behavior that is important in determining
the characteristics of the output pulse expected under these conditions.

<p>In the derivation that follows, we assume that a sufficient electric field is applied so that
electron-ion recombination is insignificant and also that the negative charges remain as free
electrons. We first derive an expression for the pulse shape for the case in which the collecting
circuit time constant is much longer than both the ion and electron collection times.</p>

<p>The pulse shape depends on the configuration of the electric field and the position at
which the ion pairs are formed with respect to the equipotential surfaces that characterize
the field geometry. To simplify the following analysis, we assume that the chamber electrodes
are parallel plates, for which the equipotential surfaces are uniformly spaced planes
parallel to the electrode surfaces, and the constant electric field intensity is given by
\[
\mathscr{E} = \frac{V}{d} \tag{5.13}
\]

Here \(V\) is the voltage across the chamber electrodes and \(d\) is their spacing. As a further simplification,
we assume that all ion pairs are formed at an equal distance \(x\) from the positive
electrode where the electric potential is equal to \(\mathscr{E}x\). This situation is sketched in Fig. 5.15.</p>

<p><img src="fig5.15.png" width="500" height="323" alt=""></p>

<p>The pulse shape is most easily derived based on arguments involving the conservation
of energy. Because the time constant of the external circuit is assumed to be large, no
appreciable current can flow during the relatively short time required to collect the charges
within the ion chamber. Therefore, the energy required to move the charges from their
place of origin must come from the energy originally stored across the capacitance \(C\), represented
by the ion chamber and associated stray capacitance. This energy is \(\frac{1}{2}CV_{0}^2\), where
\(V_0\) is the applied voltage.</p>

<p>After a time \(t\), the ions will have drifted a distance \(v^+t\) toward the cathode, where \(v^+\) is
the ion drift velocity. Similarly, the electrons will have moved a distance \(v^-t\) toward the:
anode. Both of these motions represent the movement of charge to a region of lower electric
potential, and the difference in potential energy is absorbed in the gas through the multiple
collisions the charge carriers undergo with gas molecules during their motion. This
energy is equal to \(Q\Delta\varphi\) for both the ions and electrons, where \(Q\) is the total charge and \(\Delta\varphi\)
is the change in electric potential. The charge \(Q = n_0e\), where \(n_0\) is the number of original
ion pairs and \(e\) is the electronic charge. The potential difference \(\Delta\varphi\) is the product of the
electric field h and the distance traveled toward the electrode. Conservation of energy can
therefore be written
<table align="center" cellpadding="10">

\[
\frac{1}{2}C(V_0^2 - V_{\rm ch}^2) = n_0e\mathscr{E}(v^+ + v^-)t
\]

\[
\frac{1}{2}C(V_0 + V_{\rm ch})(V_0 - V_{\rm ch}) = n_0e\left(\frac{V_{\rm ch}}{d}(v^+ + v^-)t\right) \tag{5.14}
\]
</p>

<p>The signal voltage is measured across \(R\) in Fig. 5.15 and is denoted as \(V_R\). Its magnitude
is almost always small compared with \(V_0\) and is given by \(V_0 - V_{\rm ch}\). We can therefore make
the approximations
\[
V_0 + V_{\rm ch} \cong 2V_0 \qquad {\rm and} \qquad \frac{V_{\rm ch}}{d} \cong \frac{V_0}{d}
\]

Putting these substitutions in Eq. (5.14), we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{2}C(2V_0)V_R &=& n_0e\left(\frac{V_0}{d}\right)(v^+ + v^-)t \\
V_R &=& \frac{n_0e}{dC}(v^+ + v^-)t \tag{5.15}
\end{eqnarray}

This result describes the initial portion of the signal pulse and predicts a linear rise with
time. It is valid only for the period that both the ions and electrons are drifting within the
chamber.</p>

<p>The concept of induced charge is sometimes used to describe the changes caused by
the drifting charge carriers. By drifting a distance \(v^+t\), the ions cause the chamber voltage
to drop by an amount equal to \(n_0ev^+t/dC\). The same effect would be caused by the reduction
of the charge stored across the capacitance \(C\) by an amount \(n_0ev^+t/d\). Therefore, the
ion motion can be thought of as inducing a charge of this magnitude. A similar induced
charge is created by the electron motion. It should be emphasized that the induced charge
results only from the motion of the charge carriers within the chamber volume and does
not require their collection at either electrode.</p>

<p>After a time \(t^- \equiv x/v^-\), the electrons reach the anode. Their drift has then contributed
the maximum possible to the signal voltage, and the second term in Eq. (5.15) becomes a
constant equal to its value at \(t^-\). This constant value is \(n_0ev^-t^-/dC\) or \(n_0ex/dC\). For the next
period of time, only the ions are still drifting, and Eq. (5.15) takes the form
\[
V_R = \frac{n_0e}{dC}(v^+ + x) \tag{5.16}
\]

The ions reach the cathode after a time \(t^+ \equiv (d - x)/v^+\). At this point, the signal voltage
no longer increases, and Eq. (5.15) becomes
\[
V_R = \frac{n_0e}{dC}[(d - x) + x]
\]

or
\[
V_R = \frac{n_0e}{C} \tag{5.17}
\]
</p>

<p>The shape of the signal pulse predicted by Eqs. (5.15), (5.16), and (5.17) is shown in
Fig. 5.16. </p>

<p><img src="fig5.16.png" width="464" height="314" alt=""></p>

When the collection circuit time constant is very large, or \(RC \gg t^+\), the maximum
amplitude of the signal pulse is given by
\[
V_{\rm max} = \frac{n_0e}{C} \tag{5.18}
\]

and is independent of the position at which the ion pairs were formed within the chamber.
Under these conditions, a measurement of the pulse amplitude \(V_{\rm max}\) gives a direct indication
of the original number of ion pairs no that contributed to the pulse.

<p>In electron-sensitive operation, however, the portion of the pulse derived above that corresponds
to drift of the ions is almost entirely lost by choosing a collection time constant that
is much shorter than the ion collection time. The pulse that remains then reflects only the
drift of the electrons and will have an amplitude given by Eq. (5.16) (neglecting ion drift)
\[
V\left|_{\rm elec} = \frac{n_0e}{C}\cdot\frac{x}{d}\right. \tag{5.19}
\]

The shape of this pulse is also sketched in Fig. 5.16. Only the fast rising portion of the pulse
is preserved, and the amplitude is now dependent on the position \(x\) at which the electrons
were originally formed within the chamber.</p>

<p>In any real situation, the incident radiation creates ion pairs over a range of positions
within the chamber. The sharp discontinuities shown in Fig. 5.16 are then somewhat
"washed out" in the resulting pulse shape. Electron-sensitive operation will also lead to a
situation in which a range of pulse amplitudes will be produced for monoenergetic incident
radiation, often a decided disadvantage.</p>
<h3>C. The Gridded Ion Chamber</h3>
The dependence of the pulse amplitude on position of interaction in electron-sensitive ion
chambers can be removed through the use of an arrangement sketched in Fig. 5.17. 

<p><img src="fig5.17.png" width="615" height="599" alt=""></p>

Here the volume of the ion chamber is divided into two parts by a <i>Frisch grid</i>, named after the
originator of the design. Through the use of external collimation or preferential location
of the radiation source, all the radiation interactions are confined to the volume between
the grid and the cathode of the chamber. Positive ions simply drift from this volume to the
cathode. The grid is maintained at an intermediate potential between the two electrodes
and is made to be as transparent as possible to electrons. Electrons are therefore drawn initially
from the interaction volume toward the grid. Because of the location of the load resistor
in the circuit, neither the downward drift of the ions nor the upward drift of the electrons
as far as the grid produces any measured signal voltage. However, once the electrons
pass through the grid on their way to the anode, the grid-anode voltage begins to drop and
a signal voltage begins to develop across the resistor. The same type of argument that led
to Eq. (5.15) predicts that, for a circuit time constant large compared with the electron collection
time, the time-dependent signal voltage across the resistor is
\[
V_R = \frac{n_0e}{dC}v^-t \tag{5.20}
\]

where \(d\) is now the grid-anode spacing. This linear rise continues until the electrons reach
the anode (see Fig. 5.17b). The maximum signal voltage is therefore
\[
V_{\rm max} = \frac{n_0e}{C} \tag{5.21}
\]

which is identical to Eq. (5.18). However, now the signal is derived only from the drift of
electrons rather than from the motion of both electrons and positive ions. The slow rise corresponding
to the drift of ions is eliminated, and the circuit time constant can therefore be
set at a much shorter value typical of the electron-sensitive mode of operation described in
the previous section. Since each electron passes through the same potential difference and
contributes equally to the signal pulse, the pulse amplitude is now independent of the position
of formation of the original ion pairs and is simply proportional to the total number
of ion pairs formed along the track of the incident particle.

<h3>D. Pulse Amplitude</h3>
The typical amplitude of an ion chamber pulse is relatively small. From the analysis given
in the previous sections, the maximum pulse amplitude to be expected from the creation of
no ion pairs in either a standard or gridded ion chamber is given by
\[
V_{\rm max} = \frac{n_0e}{C} \tag{5.22}
\]

If a \(1 MeV\) charged particle loses all its energy within the chamber, \(n_0\) can be estimated as
\[
n_0 = \frac{E_0}{W} \cong \frac{10^6eV}{35eV/{\rm ion\,pair}} = 2.86 \times 10^4
\]

For typical ion chambers and associated wiring, the capacitance \(C\) will be of the order of
\(10^{-10} farads\). We then calculate a pulse amplitude of
\[
V_{\rm max} = \frac{(2.86\times 10^4)(1.60\times 10^{-19}C)}{(10^{-10}F)} = 4.58\times 10^{-5}V
\]

Signals of this size can be processed successfully but require the use of relatively sophisticated
preamplifiers and pulse-processing electronics to avoid loss of their inherent resolution.

<p>In ion chambers of ordinary size and pressure, pulses from fast electron or gamma-ray
interactions will be much smaller. The value of \(n_0\) in the above example will be smaller by
as much as a factor of 100 because of the low \(dE/dx\) along the primary or secondary electron
tracks through the gas. It then becomes difficult or impossible to amplify these very
small pulses successfully without severe deterioration that results from various sources of
noise in the signal chain. For these reasons, the detectors described in the following two
chapters, which take advantage of internal gas multiplication of the charge, are usually preferred
because of their resulting larger signal pulses. Exceptions in which pulse-mode ion
chambers can be applied to gamma-ray measurements are given in Chapter 19 in which
either a liquid or high-pressure fill gas are of sufficient density to fully stop the secondary
electrons and thus restore the value of \(n_0\) to nearer that given in the example.</p>

<h3>E. Statistical Limit to Energy Resolution</h3>
The theoretical limit to the energy resolution set by the statistics of charge carrier formation
in an ion chamber can be predicted from the discussion given in Chapter 4. As an
example, let us assume that alpha particles with energy of \(5.5 MeV\) are fully stopped in a
gas with \(W\)-value of \(30 eV/{\rm ion\,pair}\) and a Fano factor of 0.15. As a first step, we can calculate
the expected average number of ion pairs \(n_0\) produced in the gas to be
\[
n_0 = \frac{E_d}{W} = \frac{5.5 \times 10^6 eV}{30 eV/{\rm ion\,pair}} = 1.83 \times 10^5 {\rm ion\,pairs}
\]

The variance in this number is given by
\[
\sigma_{n_0}^2 = Fn_0 = 0.15(1.83 \times 10^5) = 2.75 \times 10^4
\]

The standard deviation, or the square root of the variance, is then
\[
\sigma_{n_0} = \sqrt{Fn_0} = \sqrt{2.75 \times 10^4} = 166
\]

For the expected Gaussian distribution describing \(n_0\), the full-width-at-half-maximum
(FWHM) is just the shape factor of 2.35 multiplied by \(\sigma\), leading to
\[
{\rm FWHM}(n_0) = 2.35\sigma_{n_0} = 390 
\]

Finally, since \(W\) units of energy are required to create one ion pair, the FWHM in units of
particle energy is
\[
{\rm FWHM}(E) = 2.35\sigma_{n_0}\cdot W = 390(30eV) = 11.7keV
\]

For ion chambers, this figure would conventionally be quoted as the energy resolution.
Alternatively, the energy resolution could be quoted as a percentage by dividing the above,
figure by the deposited energy
\[
R = \frac{2.35\sigma_{n_0}W}{E_d} = \frac{11.7 \times 10^3 eV}{5.5 \times 10^6 eV} = 0.213\%
\]

This excellent energy resolution is almost never achieved in practice (see below) because
sources of electronic noise dominate over the statistical contributions.

<h3>F. Charged Particle Spectroscopy</h3>
There are applications in which pulse-type ion chambers can be used to good advantage for
the measurement of charged particle energies. Although it is much more common to use
semiconductor detectors for this purpose (see Chapter 11), ion chambers offer features that
may be attractive in some circumstances. They can be constructed with almost arbitrary size
and geometry, and the gas pressure can be chosen to tailor the stopping power or effective
thickness of the active volume. Ion chambers are also far less subject to performance degradation
due to radiation damage than are semiconductor detectors. Their design is generally
quite simple, and they can be fabricated by many users with standard workshop facilities.

<p>Pulse-type ion chambers have found application in a number of circumstances where
their unrestricted size and other characteristics have been exploited. They have proved
useful in low-level alpha particle measurement where parallel-plate-type gridded ion
chambers have been constructed with cross-sectional areas up to \(500 cm^2\). Even larger
chambers can conveniently be constructed by using cylindrical geometry. In order to
achieve good energy resolution, a Frisch grid is normally incorporated into the chamber
design. Because of the small amplitude of typical pulses, special care must be taken in
choosing a low noise preamplifier and in minimizing mechanical vibrations, which, by modulating
the detector capacitance, can give rise to interfering microphonic noise. Using
standard techniques, one can achieve energy resolution for \(5 MeV\) alpha particles of \(35-45 keV\) 
for such chambers. By using a cooled preamplifier to reduce the electronic noise,
Bertolini demonstrated an energy resolution of \(11.5 keV\) for alpha particles, essentially
the ultimate limit set by charge carrier statistics. This energy resolution is comparable to
the best that can currently be achieved using silicon semiconductor detectors.</p>

<p>In the conventional configuration, an entrance window for the chamber is provided so
that the charged particles travel perpendicular to the electric field lines as shown in Fig. 5.17a.
In that case, all the electrons formed along a given track are approximately equidistant from
the grid, and each will have approximately the same drift time. The voltage pulse therefore
has the general characteristics shown in Fig. 5.17b and all particle tracks give signal pulses of
similar shape. It has been demonstrated that there can be some advantage in designing the
chamber so that the particle tracks are parallel rather than perpendicular to the field lines.
Then the drift time of electrons to the grid will be different for those formed at the beginning
of the track compared with those near the end. The detailed shape of the rise of the output
pulse will therefore reflect the spatial distribution of ion pairs as they were formed along the
track of the incident particle. Because this spatial distribution is conventionally called a
<i>Bragg curve</i> (see p. 32), an analysis of the pulse shape to yield information on this spatial distribution
is conventionally called <i>Bragg curve spectroscopy</i>. This approach has proved to be
very useful in extending the information obtained from gridded ion chambers beyond a simple
measurement of the energy of the particle. Appropriate analysis of the pulse shape
can distinguish between particles of different type (atomic number and/or charge state)
through differences in the shape of their Bragg curve.</p>
